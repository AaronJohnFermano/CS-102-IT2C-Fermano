"1","Regulating Large Language Models: A Roundtable Report","Gabriel Nicholas, Paul Friedl","Computers and Society (cs.CY)","Abstract:On July 20, 2023, a group of 27 scholars and digital rights advocates with expertise in law, computer science, political science, and other disciplines gathered for the Large Language Models, Law and Policy Roundtable, co-hosted by the NYU School of Law's Information Law Institute and the Center for Democracy & Technology. The roundtable convened to discuss how law and policy can help address some of the larger societal problems posed by large language models (LLMs). The discussion focused on three policy topic areas in particular:
1. Truthfulness: What risks do LLMs pose in terms of generating mis- and disinformation? How can these risks be mitigated from a technical and/or regulatory perspective?
2. Privacy: What are the biggest privacy risks involved in the creation, deployment, and use of LLMs? How can these risks be mitigated from a technical and/or regulatory perspective?
3. Market concentration: What threats do LLMs pose concerning market/power concentration? How can these risks be mitigated from a technical and/or regulatory perspective?
In this paper, we provide a detailed summary of the day's proceedings. We first recap what we deem to be the most important contributions made during the issue framing discussions. We then provide a list of potential legal and regulatory interventions generated during the brainstorming discussions.","Fri, 16 Feb 2024 21:49:17 UTC (351 KB)"
"2","Incentivizing News Consumption on Social Media Platforms Using Large Language Models and Realistic Bot Accounts","Hadi Askari, Anshuman Chhabra, Bernhard Clemm von Hohenberg, Michael Heseltine, Magdalena Wojcieszak","Social and Information Networks (cs.SI)","Abstract:Polarization, declining trust, and wavering support for democratic norms are pressing threats to U.S. democracy. Exposure to verified and quality news may lower individual susceptibility to these threats and make citizens more resilient to misinformation, populism, and hyperpartisan rhetoric. This project examines how to enhance users' exposure to and engagement with verified and ideologically balanced news in an ecologically valid setting. We rely on a large-scale two-week long field experiment (from 1/19/2023 to 2/3/2023) on 28,457 Twitter users. We created 28 bots utilizing GPT-2 that replied to users tweeting about sports, entertainment, or lifestyle with a contextual reply containing two hardcoded elements: a URL to the topic-relevant section of quality news organization and an encouragement to follow its Twitter account. To further test differential effects by gender of the bots, treated users were randomly assigned to receive responses by bots presented as female or male. We examine whether our over-time intervention enhances the following of news media organization, the sharing and the liking of news content and the tweeting about politics and the liking of political content. We find that the treated users followed more news accounts and the users in the female bot treatment were more likely to like news content than the control. Most of these results, however, were small in magnitude and confined to the already politically interested Twitter users, as indicated by their pre-treatment tweeting about politics. These findings have implications for social media and news organizations, and also offer direction for future work on how Large Language Models and other computational interventions can effectively enhance individual on-platform engagement with quality news and public affairs.","Wed, 20 Mar 2024 07:44:06 UTC (4,259 KB)[v2] Thu, 21 Mar 2024 21:56:49 UTC (4,259 KB)"
"3","Correcting misinformation on social media with a large language model","Xinyi Zhou, Ashish Sharma, Amy X. Zhang, Tim Althoff","Computation and Language (cs.CL)","Abstract:Misinformation undermines public trust in science and democracy, particularly on social media where inaccuracies can spread rapidly. Experts and laypeople have shown to be effective in correcting misinformation by manually identifying and explaining inaccuracies. Nevertheless, this approach is difficult to scale, a concern as technologies like large language models (LLMs) make misinformation easier to produce. LLMs also have versatile capabilities that could accelerate misinformation correction; however, they struggle due to a lack of recent information, a tendency to produce plausible but false content and references, and limitations in addressing multimodal information. To address these issues, we propose MUSE, an LLM augmented with access to and credibility evaluation of up-to-date information. By retrieving contextual evidence and refutations, MUSE can provide accurate and trustworthy explanations and references. It also describes visuals and conducts multimodal searches for correcting multimodal misinformation. We recruit fact-checking and journalism experts to evaluate corrections to real social media posts across 13 dimensions, ranging from the factuality of explanation to the relevance of references. The results demonstrate MUSE's ability to correct misinformation promptly after appearing on social media; overall, MUSE outperforms GPT-4 by 37% and even high-quality corrections from laypeople by 29%. This work underscores the potential of LLMs to combat real-world misinformation effectively and efficiently.","Sun, 17 Mar 2024 10:59:09 UTC (28,311 KB)"

Wieners, Anna S. von der Heydt","Physics and Society (physics.soc-ph)","Abstract:Climate policy has become increasingly politicized in many countries including the US, with some political parties unwilling to pursue strong measures. Therefore, to be successful in mitigation, climate policies must be politically feasible. Currently, climate mitigation pathways are explored in so-called Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs) which evaluate climate policies from an economic perspective, typically focusing on cost-effectiveness and overlooking transition costs. However, the economy is intertwined with the political system, in which policymakers impose economic policies, but are (in democracies) dependent on public opinion, which in turn can be influenced by economic performance. In cases where some parties are much less ambitious in climate mitigation than others, climate policy can be abruptly disrupted, influencing voting behaviour. In this study, we analyze the political feasibility of a set of green policies in case some parties are strongly unwilling to protect the climate. We show that this simple additional social layer of complexity largely affects the outcome of the abatement measures. In particular, we conclude that a (high) pure carbon tax is particularly vulnerable to abrupt interruptions and its economic side effects discourage votes for green parties. Nevertheless, a strategically selected combination of policies can reduce political uncertainty, resulting in a more feasible and effective mitigation measure.","Tue, 12 Mar 2024 14:18:20 UTC (3,645 KB)"

This results in a power structure in which certain agents possess more voting weight than others. As a result, it opens up certain possibilities of vote manipulation, including control and bribery, that do not exist in standard voting scenarios of direct democracy. Here we formalize a certain kind of election control -- in which an external agent may change certain delegation arcs -- and study the computational complexity of the corresponding combinatorial problem.","Tue, 12 Mar 2024 11:42:42 UTC (4,111 KB)"

Understanding how online hate affects its targets is thus paramount. We analyse 10 million tweets directed at female candidates in the Brazilian election in 2022 and examine their reactions to online misogyny. Using a self-trained machine learning classifier to detect Portuguese misogynistic tweets and a quantitative analysis of the candidates' tweeting behaviour, we investigate how the number of misogynistic attacks received alters the online activity of the female candidates. We find that young and left-wing candidates and candidates with higher visibility online received significantly more attacks. Furthermore, we find that an increase in misogynistic attacks in the previous week is associated with a decrease in female candidates' tweets in the following week. This potentially threatens their equal participation in public opinion building and silences women's voices in political discourse.","Tue, 12 Mar 2024 10:59:30 UTC (1,488 KB)[v2] Sat, 16 Mar 2024 09:36:26 UTC (1,488 KB)"
"7","Elections in the Post-Quantum Era: Is the Complexity Shield Strong Enough?","Šimon Schierreich","Cryptography and Security (cs.CR)","Abstract:The election, a cornerstone of democracy, is one of the best-recognizable symbols of democratic governance. Voters' confidence in elections is essential, and these days, we can watch practically in live broadcast what consequences distrust in the fairness of elections may have. From the times of the celebrated Gibbard-Satterthwaite theorem, it is well-known in the social-choice community that most voting systems are vulnerable to the efforts of various players to influence elections. Luckily for us, computing such influence to affect election outcomes is a hard problem from the computational complexity perspective. This intractability is regarded as a ``complexity shield'' that secures voting rules against this malicious behavior.
In this work, we consider quantum computers to be a new threat to the complexity shield described above, as they break out of standard computing paradigms and unlock additional computational resources. To this end, we provide an overview of possible attacks on election, discuss the abilities of quantum computing, and chart possible directions for future research in this area.","Fri, 8 Mar 2024 12:52:11 UTC (67 KB)"

This paper introduces the design of ClarifAI, a novel automated propaganda detection tool designed to nudge readers towards more critical news consumption by activating the analytical mode of thinking, following Kahneman's dual-system theory of cognition. Using Large Language Models, ClarifAI detects propaganda in news articles and provides context-rich explanations, enhancing users' understanding and critical thinking. Our contribution is threefold: first, we propose the design of ClarifAI; second, in an online experiment, we demonstrate that this design effectively encourages news readers to engage in more critical reading; and third, we emphasize the value of explanations for fostering critical thinking. The study thus offers both a practical tool and useful design knowledge for mitigating propaganda in digital news.","Thu, 29 Feb 2024 13:12:31 UTC (1,975 KB)"
"9","Replicating Electoral Success","Kiran Tomlinson, Tanvi Namjoshi, Johan Ugander, Jon Kleinberg","Computer Science and Game Theory (cs.GT)","Abstract:A core tension in the study of plurality elections is the clash between the classic Hotelling-Downs model, which predicts that two office-seeking candidates should position themselves at the median voter's policy, and the empirical observation that real-world democracies often have two major parties with divergent policies. Motivated by this tension and drawing from bounded rationality, we introduce a dynamic model of candidate positioning based on a simple behavioral heuristic: candidates imitate the policy of previous winners. The resulting model is closely connected to evolutionary replicator dynamics and exhibits complex behavior, despite its simplicity. For uniformly-distributed voters, we prove that when there are $k = 2$, $3$, or $4$ candidates per election, any symmetric candidate distribution converges over time to a concentration of candidates at the center. With $k \ge 5$, however, we prove that the candidate distribution does not converge to the center. For initial distributions without any extreme candidates, we prove a stronger statement than non-convergence, showing that the density in an interval around the center goes to zero when $k \ge 5$. As a matter of robustness, our conclusions are qualitatively unchanged if a small fraction of candidates are not winner-copiers and are instead positioned uniformly at random. Beyond our theoretical analysis, we illustrate our results in simulation; for five or more candidates, we find a tendency towards the emergence of two clusters, a mechanism suggestive of Duverger's Law, the empirical finding that plurality leads to two-party systems. Our simulations also explore several variations of the model, including non-uniform voter distributions and other forms of noise, which exhibit similar convergence patterns. Finally, we discuss the relationship between our model and prior work on strategic equilibria of candidate positioning games.","Tue, 27 Feb 2024 01:04:07 UTC (4,073 KB)"

However, legal documents are often challenging to understand for people without legal backgrounds. In this paper, we present a novel application of large language models (LLMs) in legal education to help non-experts learn intricate legal concepts through storytelling, an effective pedagogical tool in conveying complex and abstract concepts. We also introduce a new dataset LegalStories, which consists of 295 complex legal doctrines, each accompanied by a story and a set of multiple-choice questions generated by LLMs. To construct the dataset, we experiment with various LLMs to generate legal stories explaining these concepts. Furthermore, we use an expert-in-the-loop method to iteratively design multiple-choice questions. Then, we evaluate the effectiveness of storytelling with LLMs through an RCT experiment with legal novices on 10 samples from the dataset. We find that LLM-generated stories enhance comprehension of legal concepts and interest in law among non-native speakers compared to only definitions. Moreover, stories consistently help participants relate legal concepts to their lives. Finally, we find that learning with stories shows a higher retention rate for non-native speakers in the follow-up assessment. Our work has strong implications for using LLMs in promoting teaching and learning in the legal field and beyond.","Mon, 26 Feb 2024 20:56:06 UTC (3,242 KB)"

During the last two decades, leveraging research in psychology, sociology, neuroscience and other domains, Web platforms have brought the process of capturing attention to an unprecedented scale. With the initial commonplace goal of making targeted advertising more effective, the generalization of attention-capturing techniques and their use of cognitive biases and emotions have multiple detrimental side effects such as polarizing opinions, spreading false information and threatening public health, economies and democracies. This is clearly a case where the Web is not used for the common good and where, in fact, all its users become a vulnerable population. This paper brings together contributions from a wide range of disciplines to analyze current practices and consequences thereof. Through a set of propositions and principles that could be used do drive further works, it calls for actions against these practices competing to capture our attention on the Web, as it would be unsustainable for a civilization to allow attention to be wasted with impunity on a world-wide scale.","Mon, 26 Feb 2024 15:46:43 UTC (70 KB)"

The repetition of these divisive events are the hallmark of a split society; to the physicist, however, it is an astonishing feat for such large collections of diverse individuals. Many sociophysics models reproduce the emergence of collective human behavior with interacting agents, which respond to their environment according to simple rules, modulated by random fluctuations. A paragon of this class is the Ising model which, when interactions are strong, predicts that order can emerge from a chaotic initial state. In contrast with many elections, however, this model favors a strong majority. Here, we introduce a new element to this classical theory, which accounts for the influence of opinion polls on the electorate. This brings about a new phase in which two groups divide the opinion equally. These political camps are spatially segregated, and the sharp boundary that separates them makes the system size-dependent, even in the limit of a large electorate. Election data show that, over the last 30 years, countries with more than about a million voters often found themselves in this state, whereas elections in smaller countries yielded more consensual results. We suggest that this transition hinges on the electorate's awareness of the general opinion.","Mon, 19 Feb 2024 15:12:10 UTC (626 KB)"

Despite its significance, the modelling of these negotiations has remained unexplored with the domain of Natural Language Processing (NLP), mostly due to lack of proper data. In this paper, we introduce coalition negotiations as a novel NLP task, and model it as a negotiation between large language model-based agents. We introduce a multilingual dataset, POLCA, comprising manifestos of European political parties and coalition agreements over a number of elections in these countries. This dataset addresses the challenge of the current scope limitations in political negotiation modelling by providing a diverse, real-world basis for simulation. Additionally, we propose a hierarchical Markov decision process designed to simulate the process of coalition negotiation between political parties and predict the outcomes. We evaluate the performance of state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) as agents in handling coalition negotiations, offering insights into their capabilities and paving the way for future advancements in political modelling.","Sun, 18 Feb 2024 21:28:06 UTC (9,092 KB)"

Wilson","Physics and Society (physics.soc-ph)","Abstract:A critical issue for society today is the emergence and decline of democracy worldwide. It is unclear, however, how democratic features, such as elections and civil liberties, influence this change. Democracy indices, which are the standard tool to study this question, are based on the a priori assumption that improvement in any individual feature strengthens democracy overall. We show that this assumption does not always hold. We use the V-Dem dataset for a quantitative study of electoral regimes worldwide during the 20th century. We find a so-far overlooked trade-off between election quality and civil liberties. In particular, we identify a threshold in the democratisation process at which the correlation between election quality and civil liberties flips from negative to positive. Below this threshold we can thus clearly separate two kinds of non-democratic regimes: autocracies that govern through tightly controlled elections and regimes in which citizens are free but under less certainty -- a distinction that existing democracy indices cannot make. We discuss the stabilising role of election quality uncovered here in the context of the recently observed decline in democracy score of long-standing democracies, so-called `democratic backsliding' or `democratic recession'.","Sat, 17 Feb 2024 17:06:19 UTC (2,840 KB)"

However, how to interpret the outcomes of the discussions on these platforms is often unclear. In this paper, we propose a novel and explainable method for selecting a set of most representative, consistent points of view by combining methods from computational social choice and abstract argumentation. Specifically, we model online discussions as abstract argumentation frameworks combined with information regarding which arguments voters approve of. Based on ideas from approval-based multiwinner voting, we introduce several voting rules for selecting a set of preferred extensions that represents voters' points of view. We compare the proposed methods across several dimensions, theoretically and in numerical simulations, and give clear suggestions on which methods to use depending on the specific situation.","Thu, 8 Feb 2024 18:35:38 UTC (1,894 KB)"

We present an incremental training procedure that identifies and removes redundant classifiers from an ensemble via delegation mechanisms inspired by liquid democracy. Through both analysis and extensive experiments we show that this process greatly reduces the computational cost of training compared to training a full ensemble. By carefully selecting the underlying delegation mechanism, weight centralization in the classifier population is avoided, leading to higher accuracy than some boosting methods. Furthermore, this work serves as an exemplar of how frameworks from computational social choice literature can be applied to problems in nontraditional domains.","Tue, 30 Jan 2024 21:11:35 UTC (6,080 KB)"

Using the number of protestors as the measurement of daily protesting intensity from 2019/6/6 to 2020/1/17, this paper documents that the stock price of listed companies associated with the pan-democratic parties were more negatively affected by protesting than other companies. Furthermore, this paper finds that after the implementation of the anti-mask law, protesting had a positive impact on red chips but a negative impact on companies related to pan-democracy parties. Therefore, this paper believes that after the central government and the HKSAR government adopted strict measures to stop violence and chaos, the value of the political connection of red chips became positive while the value of the connection with pan-democracy parties became negative.","Tue, 28 Nov 2023 21:44:09 UTC (1,090 KB)"

Social media can significantly influence the global political landscape, allowing governments and other political entities to engage in concerted information operations, shaping or manipulating domestic and foreign political agendas. In response to state-linked political manipulation tactics on social media, Twitter and Meta carried out take-down operations against propaganda networks, accusing them of interfering foreign elections, organizing disinformation campaigns, manipulating political debates and many other issues. This research investigates the two SMCs' policy orientation to explain which factors can affect these two companies' reaction against state-linked information operations. We find that good governance indicators such as democracy are significant elements of SMCs' country-focus. This article also examines whether Meta and Twitter's attention to political regime characteristics is influenced by international political alignments. This research illuminates recent trends in SMCs' take-down operations and illuminating interplay between geopolitics and domestic regime characteristics.","Thu, 4 Jan 2024 06:53:25 UTC (671 KB)"
"20","Consumer Manipulation via Online Behavioral Advertising","Lex Zard","Computers and Society (cs.CY)","Abstract:Online behavioral advertising (OBA) has a significant role in the digital economy. It allows advertisers to target consumers categorized according to their algorithmically inferred interests based on their behavioral data. As Alphabet and Meta gatekeep the Internet with their digital platforms and channel most of the consumer attention online, they are best placed to execute OBA and earn profits far exceeding fair estimations. There are increasing concerns that gatekeepers achieve such profitability at the expense of consumers, advertisers, and publishers who are dependent on their services to access the Internet. In particular, some claim that OBA systematically exploits consumers' decision-making vulnerabilities, creating internet infrastructure and relevant markets that optimize for consumer manipulation.
Intuitively, consumer manipulation via OBA comes in tension with the ideal of consumer autonomy in liberal democracies. Nevertheless, academia has largely overlooked this phenomenon and instead has primarily focused on privacy and discrimination concerns of OBA. This article redirects academic discourse and regulatory focus on consumer manipulation via OBA. In doing so, first, this article elaborates on how OBA works. Second, it constructs an analytic framework for understanding manipulation. Third, it applies the theory of manipulation to OBA. As a result, this article illustrates the extent to which OBA leads to consumer manipulation. Crucially, this article is purely analytic and avoids normative evaluation of consumer manipulation via OBA. Evaluating consumer manipulation harms of OBA is an equally important but separate task and is pursued in another publication.","Sat, 30 Dec 2023 11:10:35 UTC (1,083 KB)"

Such ballots are unravelled into a profile of direct votes by selecting one entry from each ballot so as not to introduce cyclic dependencies. We study delegation via monotonic Boolean functions, and two unravelling procedures: MinSum, which minimises the sum of the ranks of the chosen entries, and its egalitarian counterpart, MinMax. We provide complete computational dichotomies: MinSum is hard to compute (and approximate) as soon as any non-trivial functions are permitted, and polynomial otherwise; for MinMax the easiness results extend to arbitrary-arity logical ORs and ANDs taken in isolation, but not beyond. For the classic model of delegating to individual agents, we give asymptotically near-tight algorithms for carrying out the two procedures and efficient algorithms for finding optimal unravellings with the highest vote count for a given alternative. These algorithms inspire novel tie-breaking rules for the setup of voting to change a status quo. We then introduce a new axiom, which can be viewed as a variant of the participation axiom, and use algorithmic techniques developed earlier in the paper to show that it is satisfied by MinSum and a lexicographic refinement of MinMax (but not MinMax itself).","Tue, 19 Dec 2023 08:18:26 UTC (48 KB)"

It draws inspiration from the theory of 'Brussels Effect' and its precedents, that describes the extraterritorial influence of EU regulations. Our objective is not to provide a commentary on China's legal development but to illuminate the intricate dynamics between the Chinese law and the EU's GDPR. It is argued that the trajectory of China's Personal Information Protection Law calls into question the applicability of the Brussels Effect: while the GDPR's imprint on the PIPL is evident, a deeper analysis unveils China's nuanced, non-linear adoption that diverges from many assumptions of the Brussels Effect and similar theories. The evolution of the GDPR-inspired PIPL is not as a straightforward outcome of the Brussels Effect but as a nuanced, intricate interplay of external influence and domestic dynamics. We introduce a complementary theory of 'gravity assist' which portrays China's strategic instrumentalisation of the GDPR as a template to shape its unique data protection landscape. Our conceptual framework highlights how China navigates through a patchwork of internal considerations, international standards, and strategic choices, ultimately sculpting a data protection regime that has a similar appearance to the GDPR but aligns with its distinct political, cultural and legal landscape. This reveals much about how China takes in the foundational premises of data protection that are inherently built in Europe's cherishment of the rule of law, democracy and human rights on the one hand, and the evaluation of data protection as a fundamental right.","Wed, 13 Dec 2023 15:58:40 UTC (408 KB)"

However, existing studies are often limited to a single country and one form of polarization, hindering a comprehensive understanding of the phenomena. Here we investigate how affective and interactional polarization are related across nine countries (Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Spain, Turkey, UK, USA). First, we show that political interaction networks are polarized on Twitter. Second, we reveal that out-group interactions, defined by the network, are more toxic than in-group interactions, meaning that affective and interactional polarization are aligned. Third, we show that out-group interactions receive lower engagement than in-group interactions. Finally, we show that the political right reference lower reliability media than the political left, and that interactions between politically engaged accounts are limited and rarely reciprocated. These results hold across countries and represent a first step towards a more unified understanding of polarization.","Thu, 30 Nov 2023 13:18:05 UTC (1,908 KB)"

Meanwhile, detecting deepfakes, at scale, remains a very challenging tasks that often requires labeled training data from existing deepfake generation methods. Further, even the most accurate supervised learning, deepfake detection methods do not generalize to deepfakes generated using new generation methods. In this paper, we introduce a novel unsupervised approach for detecting deepfake videos by measuring of intra- and cross-modal consistency among multimodal features; specifically visual, audio, and identity features. The fundamental hypothesis behind the proposed detection method is that since deepfake generation attempts to transfer the facial motion of one identity to another, these methods will eventually encounter a trade-off between motion and identity that enviably leads to detectable inconsistencies. We validate our method through extensive experimentation, demonstrating the existence of significant intra- and cross- modal inconsistencies in deepfake videos, which can be effectively utilized to detect them with high accuracy. Our proposed method is scalable because it does not require pristine samples at inference, generalizable because it is trained only on real data, and is explainable since it can pinpoint the exact location of modality inconsistencies which are then verifiable by a human expert.","Tue, 28 Nov 2023 03:28:19 UTC (1,618 KB)"

Privacy-preserving identity attestations can drastically reduce instances of impersonation and make disinformation easy to identify and potentially hinder. By understanding how identity attestations are positioned across the spectrum of decentralization, we can gain a better understanding of the costs and benefits of various attestations. In this paper, we discuss attestation types, including governmental, biometric, federated, and web of trust-based, and include examples such as e-Estonia, China's social credit system, Worldcoin, OAuth, X (formerly Twitter), Gitcoin Passport, and EAS. We believe that the most resilient systems create an identity that evolves and is connected to a network of similarly evolving identities that verify one another. In this type of system, each entity contributes its respective credibility to the attestation process, creating a larger, more comprehensive set of attestations. We believe these systems could be the best approach to authenticating identity and protecting against some of the threats to democracy that AI can pose in the hands of malicious actors. However, governments will likely attempt to mitigate these risks by implementing centralized identity authentication systems; these centralized systems could themselves pose risks to the democratic processes they are built to defend. We therefore recommend that policymakers support the development of standards-setting organizations for identity, provide legal clarity for builders of decentralized tooling, and fund research critical to effective identity authentication systems.","Mon, 25 Sep 2023 14:15:18 UTC (345 KB)"
"26","From deepfake to deep useful: risks and opportunities through a systematic literature review","Nikolaos Misirlis, Harris Bin Munawar","Social and Information Networks (cs.SI)","Abstract:Deepfake videos are defined as a resulting media from the synthesis of different persons images and videos, mostly faces, replacing a real one. The easy spread of such videos leads to elevated misinformation and represents a threat to society and democracy today. The present study aims to collect and analyze the relevant literature through a systematic procedure. We present 27 articles from scientific databases revealing threats to society, democracies, the political life but present as well advantages of this technology in entertainment, gaming, education, and public life. The research indicates high scientific interest in deepfake detection algorithms as well as the ethical aspect of such technology. This article covers the scientific gap since, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first systematic literature review in the field. A discussion has already started among academics and practitioners concerning the spread of fake news. The next step of fake news considers the use of artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms that create hyper-realistic videos, called deepfake. Deepfake technology has continuously attracted the attention of scholars over the last 3 years more and more. The importance of conducting research in this field derives from the necessity to understand the theory. The first contextual approach is related to the epistemological points of view of the concept. The second one is related to the phenomenological disadvantages of the field. Despite that, the authors will try to focus not only on the disadvantages of the field but also on the positive aspects of the technology.","Mon, 27 Nov 2023 13:31:40 UTC (1,315 KB)"

While much attention has been placed on factors such as voter turnout and the quality of the candidates, the voting system used in an election is just as consequential in determining the winner. In Social Choice Theory, voting systems are evaluated based on whether or not they violate fairness criteria. Arrow's Impossibility Theorem states that no voting method can jointly satisfy five fairness criteria: unanimity, transitivity, independence of irrelevant alternatives, unrestricted domain, and non-dictatorship. However, voting systems are not equally likely to violate criteria. This paper takes a statistical approach to determine which of 12 voting systems is the fairest based on their probabilistic likelihood of violating nine social choice criteria. The criteria include Arrow's five conditions, the Condorcet winner and loser criteria, the majority criteria, and citizen sovereignty. Elections with up to 10 million voters and between three and six candidates are simulated using Impartial Culture and Impartial Anonymous Culture. We first compute the frequencies with which voting systems violate individual criteria and then compute Joint Satisfaction frequencies, the likelihood that a voting system jointly satisfies all nine criteria. We find that Pairwise Majority is the most likely to jointly satisfy the nine conditions, but increasingly violates transitivity as the number of candidates increases. Of the systems that satisfy transitivity, the Baldwin method has the highest Joint Satisfaction frequency in elections with three candidates. As the number of candidates increase, the Joint Satisfaction frequencies decrease rapidly for all systems.","Wed, 22 Nov 2023 03:55:09 UTC (701 KB)"

Previous research has shown how social correction can be an effective way to curb misinformation, by engaging directly in a constructive dialogue with users who spread -- often in good faith -- misleading messages. Although professional fact-checkers are crucial to debunking viral claims, they usually do not engage in conversations on social media. Thereby, significant effort has been made to automate the use of fact-checker material in social correction; however, no previous work has tried to integrate it with the style and pragmatics that are commonly employed in social media communication. To fill this gap, we present VerMouth, the first large-scale dataset comprising roughly 12 thousand claim-response pairs (linked to debunking articles), accounting for both SMP-style and basic emotions, two factors which have a significant role in misinformation credibility and spreading. To collect this dataset we used a technique based on an author-reviewer pipeline, which efficiently combines LLMs and human annotators to obtain high-quality data. We also provide comprehensive experiments showing how models trained on our proposed dataset have significant improvements in terms of output quality and generalization capabilities.","Fri, 17 Nov 2023 15:37:18 UTC (254 KB)"

Analysing a dataset of 4,006 respondents, categorised into full democracies and flawed democracies based on the Democracy Index developed by the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU), this research identifies crucial factors that shape European attitudes toward AI in these two types of democracies. The analysis reveals noteworthy findings. Firstly, it is observed that flawed democracies tend to exhibit higher levels of trust in government entities compared to their counterparts in full democracies. Additionally, individuals residing in flawed democracies demonstrate a more positive attitude toward AI when compared to respondents from full democracies. However, the study finds no significant difference in AI awareness between the two types of democracies, indicating a similar level of general knowledge about AI technologies among European citizens. Moreover, the study reveals that trust in AI measures, specifically ""Trust AI Solution"", does not significantly vary between full and flawed democracies. This suggests that despite the differences in democratic quality, both types of democracies have similar levels of confidence in AI solutions.","Wed, 4 Oct 2023 22:11:28 UTC (120 KB)"

Unlike conventional search engines, LLMs go beyond mere information retrieval, entering into the realm of discourse culture. Its outputs mimic well-considered, independent opinions or statements of facts, presenting a pretense of wisdom. This paper explores the potential transformative impact of LLMs on democratic societies. It delves into the concerns regarding the difficulty in distinguishing ChatGPT-generated texts from human output. The discussion emphasizes the essence of authorship, rooted in the unique human capacity for reason - a quality indispensable for democratic discourse and successful collaboration within free societies. Highlighting the potential threats to democracy, this paper presents three arguments: the Substitution argument, the Authenticity argument, and the Facts argument. These arguments highlight the potential risks that are associated with an overreliance on LLMs. The central thesis posits that widespread deployment of LLMs may adversely affect the fabric of a democracy if not comprehended and addressed proactively and properly. In proposing a solution, we advocate for an emphasis on education as a means to mitigate risks. We suggest cultivating thinking skills in children, fostering coherent thought formulation, and distinguishing between machine-generated output and genuine, i.e. human, reasoning. The focus should be on responsible development and usage of LLMs, with the goal of augmenting human capacities in thinking, deliberating and decision-making rather than substituting them.","Fri, 10 Nov 2023 17:47:46 UTC (217 KB)"

Due to this reason, modeling and analysis of small group interactions in the courtroom setting is an important task as it can help in understanding court decision-making. We apply probabilistic model checking for the modeling and analysis of temporal interaction dynamics in the context of the Supreme Court of the United States. We have used the transcripts of the oral arguments of cases from the Supreme Court for constructing a discrete-time Markov reward model (DTMRM). Next, we formulate interesting queries over interaction by using probabilistic computation tree logic (PCTL) and PCTL with rewards and verify them using a probabilistic symbolic model checker (PRISM). Our experimental results show that probabilistic model checking is very effective in identifying trends, hidden patterns, and how justices behave during the trials. These results not only provide valuable feedback to the justices but may also be used by the advocates and law students for finding better ways to present their arguments in the court.","Thu, 9 Nov 2023 07:28:15 UTC (88 KB)"

The preferences of a vertex extend naturally to preferences over arborescences rooted at $r$. We seek a popular arborescence in $G$, i.e., one for which there is no ""more popular"" arborescence. Popular arborescences have applications in liquid democracy or collective decision making; however, they need not exist in every input instance. The popular arborescence problem is to decide if a given input instance admits a popular arborescence or not. We show a polynomial-time algorithm for this problem, whose computational complexity was not known previously.
Our algorithm is combinatorial, and can be regarded as a primal-dual algorithm. It searches for an arborescence along with its dual certificate, a chain of subsets of $E$, witnessing its popularity. In fact, our algorithm solves the more general popular common base problem in the intersection of two matroids, where one matroid is the partition matroid defined by any partition $E = \bigcup_{v\in V} \delta(v)$ and the other is an arbitrary matroid on $E$ of rank $|V|$, with each $v \in V$ having a partial order over elements in $\delta(v)$. We extend our algorithm to the case with forced or forbidden edges.
We also study the related popular colorful forest (or more generally, the popular common independent set) problem where edges are partitioned into color classes, and the task is to find a colorful forest that is popular within the set of all colorful forests. For the case with weak rankings, we formulate the popular colorful forest polytope, and thus show that a minimum-cost popular colorful forest can be computed efficiently. By contrast, we prove that it is NP-hard to compute a minimum-cost popular arborescence, even when rankings are strict.","Mon, 30 Oct 2023 11:29:02 UTC (49 KB)"

Key features of GFE are preserved, such as individuals belonging to one of a finite number of groups and group membership is unrestricted and estimated. Ignoring group heteroskedasticity may lead to poor classification, which is detrimental to finite sample bias and standard errors of estimators. I introduce the ""weighted grouped fixed effects"" (WGFE) estimator that minimizes a weighted average of group sum of squared residuals. I establish $\sqrt{NT}$-consistency and normality under a concept of group separation based on second moments. A test of group homoskedasticity is discussed. A fast computation procedure is provided. Simulations show that WGFE outperforms alternatives that exclude second moment information. I demonstrate this approach by considering the link between income and democracy and the effect of unionization on earnings.","Sat, 21 Oct 2023 17:17:41 UTC (9,875 KB)[v2] Thu, 26 Oct 2023 02:17:36 UTC (9,876 KB)"

To investigate the life-cycle effects of social norm transmission, this study draws on the introduction of comprehensive sex education in the curriculum of Swedish primary schools during the 1940s to the 1950s. Inspired by social-democratic values, sex education during this period taught students about abstinence, rational family planning choices, and the importance of taking social responsibility for their personal decisions. The study applies a state-of-the-art estimator of the difference-in-differences method to various outcomes of men and women throughout the life cycle. The results show that the reform affected most intended outcomes for men and women, ultimately decreasing gender inequality in earnings. The effects of the reform also extended to the succeeding generation of girls. Both generations created a critical mass that altered social norms in favor of collective engagement and democracy. The findings suggest that social norms, internalized through school-based sex education, persistently affect peoples outcomes in significant ways.","Tue, 17 Oct 2023 11:17:07 UTC (4,347 KB)[v2] Mon, 11 Dec 2023 09:18:52 UTC (4,820 KB)"

The Method of Equal Shares (MES), introduced in [18], is a simple iterative method for this task, which runs in polynomial time and satisfies a demanding proportionality axiom (Extended Justified Representation) in the setting of approval utilities. However, a downside of MES is that it is non-exhaustive: given an MES outcome, it may be possible to expand it by adding new projects without violating the budget constraint. To complete the outcome, the approach currently used in practice is as follows: given an instance with budget $b$, one searches for a budget $b'\ge b$ such that when MES is executed with budget $b'$, it produces a maximal feasible solution for $b$. The search is greedy, i.e., one has to execute MES from scratch for each value of $b'$. To avoid redundant computation, we introduce a variant of MES, which we call Adaptive Method of Equal Shares (AMES). Our method is budget-adaptive, in the sense that, given an outcome $W$ for a budget $b$ and a new budget $b'>b$, it can compute the outcome $W'$ for budget $b'$ by leveraging similarities between $W$ and $W'$. This eliminates the need to recompute solutions from scratch when increasing virtual budgets. Furthermore, AMES satisfies EJR in a certifiable way: given the output of our method, one can check in time $O(n\log n+mn)$ that it provides EJR (here, $n$ is the number of voters and $m$ is the number of projects). We evaluate the potential of AMES on real-world PB data, showing that small increases in budget typically require only minor modifications of the outcome.","Mon, 16 Oct 2023 09:27:01 UTC (257 KB)"

The intense negotiations of every detail of the document brought forth numerous controversies among UNESCO member states. Drawing on a unique set of primary sources, including written positions and recorded deliberations, this paper explains the achievement of global compromise on AI regulation despite the multiplicity of UNESCO member-state positions representing a variety of liberal and sovereignist preferences. Building upon Boltanski's pragmatic sociology, it conceptualises the practice of multilateral negotiations and attributes the multilateral compromise to two embedded therein mechanisms: Structural normative hybridity and situated normative ambiguity allowed to accomplish a compromise by linking macro-normative structures with situated debates of multilateral negotiations.","Fri, 29 Sep 2023 11:46:26 UTC (398 KB)"

RLAs using CSD in this way can be substantially more efficient than RLAs that sample indiscriminately from all cast cards. We describe an open-source Python implementation of RLAs using CSD for the Hart InterCivic Verity voting system and the Dominion Democracy Suite(R) voting system. The software is demonstrated using all 181 contests in the 2020 general election and all 214 contests in the 2022 general election in Orange County, CA, USA, the fifth-largest election jurisdiction in the U.S., with over 1.8 million active voters. (Orange County uses the Hart Verity system.) To audit the 181 contests in 2020 to a risk limit of 5% without using CSD would have required a complete hand tally of all 3,094,308 cast ballot cards. With CSD, the estimated sample size is about 20,100 cards, 0.65% of the cards cast--including one tied contest that required a complete hand count. To audit the 214 contests in 2022 to a risk limit of 5% without using CSD would have required a complete hand tally of all 1,989,416 cast cards.

Spatial correlation functions reveal differences in the generic organization of different optical momenta in complex natural light fields, with the orbital current typically forming broad channels of unidirectional flow, and the spin current manifesting larger vorticity and changing direction over subwavelength distances.

Moreover, India's elderly population is projected to increase to 138 million by 2035. Indian economy is already reeling under the pressure of exorbitant pension liabilities of the government for existing pensioners. As such, India has introduced a National Pension System (NPS), which is a Defined Contribution Scheme for employees joining government service on or after 1st January 2004, bidding adieu to the age-old, tried and tested Old Pension System (OPS) which is a Direct Benefit Scheme, in vogue in India since the British Raj. This is an epoch-making move by the government as it seeks to inculcate Disciplined Saving among the people while significantly reducing the government burden by reducing the Pension Liabilities of the Central and State Governments. This paper aims to analyse various features and intricacies of the NPS and address the claims of various stakeholders like the Central Government, State Government, Employees, Pensioners, etc. In light of the above, and taking cognisance of the fact that many states such as Rajasthan, Chattisgarh, Jharkhand, etc, have exited the NPS scheme and have sought back their share of NPS employee and employer contribution, this study is relevant to address the current economic and fiscal issues of India to propel towards the ambitious goal of becoming a $ 5 trillion dollar economy by 2025.

However, tailoring recommendations to users' specific interests can result in the divergence of information streams. Fragmented access to information poses challenges to the integrity of the public sphere, thereby influencing democracy and public discourse. The Fragmentation metric quantifies the degree of fragmentation of information streams in news recommendations. Accurate measurement of this metric requires the application of Natural Language Processing (NLP) to identify distinct news events, stories, or timelines. This paper presents an extensive investigation of various approaches for quantifying Fragmentation in news recommendations. These approaches are evaluated both intrinsically, by measuring performance on news story clustering, and extrinsically, by assessing the Fragmentation scores of different simulated news recommender scenarios. Our findings demonstrate that agglomerative hierarchical clustering coupled with SentenceBERT text representation is substantially better at detecting Fragmentation than earlier implementations. Additionally, the analysis of simulated scenarios yields valuable insights and recommendations for stakeholders concerning the measurement and interpretation of Fragmentation.","Tue, 12 Sep 2023 13:01:20 UTC (213 KB)[v2] Mon, 18 Sep 2023 13:05:08 UTC (119 KB)"

At the same time, manifestly Lorentz-invariant Lagrangian description of such fields directly in terms of a $d$-dimensional field theory is challenging and requires introducing nontrivial auxiliary gauge fields eliminated on-shell with extra gauge symmetries. A recent work by Arvanitakis et al.\ demonstrates (emphasizing the case of 2d chiral bosons) that the two approaches are related, and a peculiar reduction on the $(d+1)$-dimensional topological Lagrangian automatically leads to $d$-dimensional Lagrangians with appropriate sets of auxiliary fields. We develop this setup in three distinct directions. First, we demonstrate how arbitrary Abelian self-interactions for chiral forms can be included using nonlinear boundary terms in the Chern-Simons theory. Second, by generalizing the Chern-Simons theory to the BF theory, we obtain an analogous democratic description of non-chiral form fields, where electric and magnetic potentials appear as explicit dynamical variables. Third, we discuss the effects of introducing topological interactions in the higher-dimensional bulk, which produce extra interaction terms in the boundary theory. When applied to a topological 4-form field in 12 dimensions, this construction results in a democratic description of the 3-form gauge field of the 11-dimensional supergravity.","Fri, 8 Sep 2023 22:31:56 UTC (20 KB)"

Liquid democracy, also known as delegative voting, allows voters to vote directly or delegate their voting power to others, thereby contributing to the resolution of problems such as low voter turnout. In recent years, liquid democracy has been widely adopted by Delegated-Proof-of-Stake (DPoS) blockchains and implemented successfully on platforms with millions of users. However, little is known regarding the characteristics and actual effectiveness of liquid democracy in decentralized governance. This paper explored for the first time the practical implementation of liquid democracy in DPoS blockchain systems. Using actual data collected from two major DPoS blockchains, EOS and Steem, our study compared and evaluated the participation of different types of users of DPoS blockchain systems in liquid democracy, as well as extracting and analyzing the delegation chains and networks formed during the process of liquid democracy within the systems. We believe that the findings of this paper will contribute to further studies on the design and implementation of liquid democracy and other voting mechanisms in decentralized governance.","Sun, 3 Sep 2023 06:04:11 UTC (15,993 KB)"

Bernstein","Human-Computer Interaction (cs.HC)","Abstract:How can online communities execute a focused vision for their space? Curation offers one approach, where community leaders manually select content to share with the community. Curation enables leaders to shape a space that matches their taste, norms, and values, but the practice is often intractable at social media scale: curators cannot realistically sift through hundreds or thousands of submissions daily. In this paper, we contribute algorithmic and interface foundations enabling curation at scale, and manifest these foundations in a system called Cura. Our approach draws on the observation that, while curators' attention is limited, other community members' upvotes are plentiful and informative of curators' likely opinions. We thus contribute a transformer-based curation model that predicts whether each curator will upvote a post based on previous community upvotes. Cura applies this curation model to create a feed of content that it predicts the curator would want in the community. Evaluations demonstrate that the curation model accurately estimates opinions of diverse curators, that changing curators for a community results in clearly recognizable shifts in the community's content, and that, consequently, curation can reduce anti-social behavior by half without extra moderation effort. By sampling different types of curators, Cura lowers the threshold to genres of curated social media ranging from editorial groups to stakeholder roundtables to democracies.","Sat, 26 Aug 2023 10:25:05 UTC (3,240 KB)"

But public perceptions of fairness are often keyed to partisan proportionality, or the degree of congruence between each party's share of the the vote and its share of representation. PSMD has not tended to secure proportional outcomes historically, partially due to gerrymandering, where line-drawers intentionally extract more advantage for their side. But it is now increasingly clear that even blind PSMD is frequently disproportional, and in unpredictable ways that depend on local political geography. In this paper we consider whether it is feasible to bring PSMD into alignment with a proportionality norm by targeting proportional outcomes in the design and selection of districts. We do this mainly through a close examination of the ""Freedom to Vote Test,"" a redistricting reform proposed in draft legislation in 2021. We find that applying the test with a proportionality target makes for sound policy: it performs well in legal battleground states and has a workable exception to handle edge cases where proportionality is out of reach.","Tue, 22 Aug 2023 15:56:40 UTC (5,363 KB)"

Nevertheless, literature on bribery in voting and election manipulation has frequently observed that most hardness results melt down when one focuses on the setting of (nearly) single-peaked agents, i.e., when each voter has a preferred candidate (usually, the one closer to her own belief) and preferences of remaining candidates are inversely proportional to the distance between the candidate position and the voter's belief. Unfortunately, no such analysis has been done for election manipulations run in social networks.
In this work, we try to close this gap: specifically, we consider a setting for election manipulation that naturally raises (nearly) single-peaked preferences, and we evaluate the complexity of election manipulation problem in this setting: while most of the hardness and approximation results still hold, we will show that single-peaked preferences allow to design simple, efficient and effective heuristics for election manipulation.","Mon, 21 Aug 2023 16:44:50 UTC (12,382 KB)"
"52","Vulnerability of democratic electoral systems","Tomasz Raducha, Jarosław Klamut, Roger Cremades, Paul Bouman, Mateusz Wiliński","Physics and Society (physics.soc-ph)","Abstract:The two most common types of electoral systems (ES) used in electing national legislatures are proportional representation and plurality voting. When they are evaluated, most often the arguments come from social choice theory and political sciences. The former overall uses an axiomatic approach including a list of mathematical criteria a system should fulfill. The latter predominantly focuses on the trade-off between proportionality of apportionment and governability. However, there is no consensus on the best ES, nor on the set of indexes and measures that would be the most important in such assessment. Moreover, the ongoing debate about the fairness of national elections neglects the study of their vulnerabilities. Here we address this research gap with a framework that can measure electoral systems' vulnerability to different means of influence. Using in silico analysis we show that plurality voting systems are less stable than proportional representation. They are also more susceptible to political agitators and media propaganda. A review of real-world ES reveals possible improvements in their design leading to lower susceptibility. Additionally, our simulation framework allows computation of popular indexes, as the Gallagher index or the effective number of parties, in different scenarios. Our work provides a new tool for dealing with modern threats to democracy that could destabilize voting processes. Furthermore, our results add an important argument in a long-standing discussion on evaluation of ES.","Sat, 19 Aug 2023 16:16:52 UTC (8,321 KB)"

Specifically, ChatGPT was used in place of the traditional certified trainer to test the possibility of mediating (modifying) input sentences in four processes: observation, feelings, needs, and requests. The results indicate that there is potential for the application of generative AI, although not yet at a practical level. Suggested improvement guidelines included adding model responses, relearning revised responses, specifying appropriate terminology for each process, and re-asking for required information. The use of generative AI will be useful initially to assist certified trainers, to prepare for and review events and workshops, and in the future to support consensus building and cooperative behavior in digital democracy, platform cooperatives, and cyber-human social co-operating systems. It is hoped that the widespread use of NVC mediation using generative AI will lead to the early realization of a mixbiotic society.","Mon, 7 Aug 2023 06:19:29 UTC (299 KB)"

A concern that has been raised, is that current academic literature focuses solely on static inputs, concealing a key characteristic of Liquid Democracy: the right for a voter to change her mind as time goes by, regarding her options of whether to vote herself or delegate her vote to other participants, till the final voting deadline. In real life, a period of extended deliberation preceding the election-day motivates voters to adapt their behaviour over time, either based on observations of the remaining electorate or on information acquired for the topic at hand. By adding a temporal dimension to Liquid Democracy, such adaptations can increase the number of possible delegation paths and reduce the loss of votes due to delegation cycles or delegating paths towards abstaining agents, ultimately enhancing participation. Our work takes a first step to integrate a time horizon into decision-making problems in Liquid Democracy systems. Our approach, via a computational complexity analysis, exploits concepts and tools from temporal graph theory which turn out to be convenient for our framework.","Mon, 24 Jul 2023 15:46:45 UTC (241 KB)"

To solve these problems, the philosophical world has proposed the concept of ""mixbiotic society,"" in which individuals with freedom and diverse values mix and mingle to recognize their respective ""fundamental incapability"" each other and sublimate into solidarity. Based on this concept, this study proposes new mixbiotic society measures to evaluate dynamic communication patterns with reference to classification in cellular automata and particle reaction diffusion that simulate living phenomena. Specifically, the hypothesis of measures corresponding to the four classes was formulated, and the hypothesis was validated by simulating the generation and disappearance of communication. As a result, considering communication patterns as multidimensional vectors, it found that the mean of Euclidean distance for ""mobism,"" the variance of the relative change in distance for ""atomism,"" the composite measure that multiplies the mean and variance of cosine similarity for ""mixism,"" which corresponds to the well-going of mixbiotic society, and the almost zero measures for ""nihilism,"" are suitable. Then, evaluating seven real-society datasets using these measures, we showed that the mixism measure is useful for assessing the livingness of communication, and that it is possible to typify communities based on plural measures. The measures established in this study are superior to conventional analysis in that they can evaluate dynamic patterns, they are simple to calculate, and their meanings are easy to interpret. As a future development, the mixbiotic society measures will be used in the fields of digital democracy and platform cooperativism toward a desirable society.","Fri, 21 Jul 2023 14:00:17 UTC (1,498 KB)[v2] Mon, 24 Jul 2023 18:25:46 UTC (1,933 KB)"

This is particularly the case for preferential voting methods and decision-support systems designed to promote fairer, more inclusive and legitimate collective decision-making processes in citizens assemblies, participatory budgeting and elections. However, a systematic human experimentation with different voting methods is cumbersome and costly. This paper introduces VoteLab, an open-source and thoroughly-documented platform for modular and adaptive design of voting experiments. It supports to visually and interactively build reusable campaigns with a choice of different voting methods, while voters can easily respond to subscribed voting questions on a smartphone. A proof-of-concept with four voting methods and questions on COVID-19 in an online lab experiment have been used to study the consistency of voting outcomes. It demonstrates the capability of VoteLab to support rigorous experimentation of complex voting scenarios.","Thu, 20 Jul 2023 14:26:21 UTC (1,999 KB)"

In this chapter, we introduce the notion of self-reflective AI systems for meaningful human control over AI systems. Focusing on decision support systems, we propose a framework that integrates knowledge from psychology and philosophy with formal reasoning methods and machine learning approaches to create AI systems responsive to human values and social norms. We also propose a possible research approach to design and develop self-reflective capability in AI systems. Finally, we argue that self-reflective AI systems can lead to self-reflective hybrid systems (human + AI), thus increasing meaningful human control and empowering human moral reasoning by providing comprehensible information and insights on possible human moral blind spots.","Wed, 12 Jul 2023 13:32:24 UTC (961 KB)"

But order and disorder are not only observed in wars, in many systems they are the dominant property. Understanding order and disorder enables us to understand the structure of systems. Order and disorder are also part of the Lagrange Principle, and as statistics is valid in all systems, we may regard Lagrange statistics as a mathematical basis of system science. Two systems out of natural and social science are compared: materials of trillions of atoms and politics of millions of people. Lagrange statistics leads to three phases of homogeneous systems: in materials we have the states: solid, liquid, gas, depending on two Lagrange parameters, temperature T (the mean energy of atoms) and pressure p. In politics we have three states: autocratic, democratic, global, depending on two Lagrange parameters, standard of living T (the mean capital of people) and political pressure p. The three phases of each system are compared in the p-T phase diagram: Different phases of one system cannot coexist as nearest neighbors: Water will dissolve ice by exchange of atoms and heat. This leads to the present climate crisis. Democracies will dissolve autocracies by exchange of goods, ideas, and people like guest workers. This is the peaceful history of the EU and has led to the aggressive reaction of Russia in the GDR, Hungary, ČSR, and now in the Ukraine. At the end of war peaceful coexistence will not be possible between Russia and Ukraine.

Although the ideas behind liquid democracy have garnered widespread support, there have been relatively few attempts to model it formally. This paper makes three main contributions. First, it proposes a new social choice-theoretic model of liquid democracy, which is distinguished by taking a richer formal perspective on the process by which a voter chooses a proxy. Second, it examines the model from an axiomatic perspective, proving (a) a proxy vote analogue of May's Theorem and (b) an impossibility result concerning monotonicity properties in a proxy vote setting. Third, it explores the topic of manipulation in transitive proxy votes. Two forms of manipulation specific to the proxy vote setting are defined, and it is shown that manipulation occurs in strictly more cases in proxy votes than in classical votes.","Wed, 5 Jul 2023 19:59:06 UTC (49 KB)"

These algorithms can change individual behavior deliberately (a fraud prediction algorithm deterring fraud) or inadvertently (content sorting algorithms spreading misinformation), and they are increasingly facing public scrutiny and regulation. Some of these regulations, like the elimination of cash bail in some states, have focused on \textit{lowering the stakes of certain classifications}. In this paper we characterize how optimal classification by an algorithm designer can affect the distribution of behavior in a population -- sometimes in surprising ways. We then look at the effect of democratizing the rewards and punishments, or stakes, to algorithmic classification to consider how a society can potentially stem (or facilitate!) predatory classification. Our results speak to questions of algorithmic fairness in settings where behavior and algorithms are interdependent, and where typical measures of fairness focusing on statistical accuracy across groups may not be appropriate.","Wed, 5 Jul 2023 14:22:01 UTC (461 KB)"

Delegations are transitive, and since voters may end up in a delegation cycle, they are encouraged to indicate not only a single delegate, but a set of potential delegates and a ranking among them. Based on the delegation preferences of all voters, a delegation rule selects one representative per voter. Previous work has revealed a trade-off between two properties of delegation rules called anonymity and copy-robustness.
To overcome this issue we study two fractional delegation rules: Mixed Borda branching, which generalizes a rule satisfying copy-robustness, and the random walk rule, which satisfies anonymity. Using the Markov chain tree theorem, we show that the two rules are in fact equivalent, and simultaneously satisfy generalized versions of the two properties. Combining the same theorem with Fulkerson's algorithm, we develop a polynomial-time algorithm for computing the outcome of the studied delegation rule. This algorithm is of independent interest, having applications in semi-supervised learning and graph theory.","Mon, 3 Jul 2023 17:38:38 UTC (1,116 KB)[v2] Wed, 6 Mar 2024 17:22:57 UTC (35 KB)"

Using the Galam model of opinion dynamics deployed in a five-dimensional parameter space, I show that polarization is the byproduct of an essential hallmark of a vibrant democratic society, namely the open and informal discussions among agents. Indeed, within a homogeneous social community with floaters, the dynamics leads gradually toward unanimity (zero entropy). Polarization can eventually appear as the juxtaposition of non-mixing social groups sharing different prejudices about the issue at stake. On the other hand, the inclusion of contrarian agents produces a polarization within a community that mixes when their proportion $x$ is beyond a critical value $x_c=\frac{1}{6}\approx 0.167$ for discussing groups of size 3 and 4. Similarly, the presence of stubborn agents produces also a polarization of a community that mixes when the proportion of stubborns is greater than some critical value. For equal proportions of stubborns $a$ along each opinion, $a_c=\frac{2}{9}\approx 0.22$ for group size 4 against $a_c=\frac{1}{4}= 0.25$ for group size 3. However, the evaluation of the proportion of individual opinion shifts at the attractor $\frac{1}{2}$ indicates that the polarization produced by contrarians is fluid with a good deal of agents who keep shifting between the two opposed blocks (high entropy). That favors a coexistence of opposite opinions in a divided community. In contrast, the polarization created by stubborn agents is found to be frozen with very few individuals shifting opinion between the two opinions (low entropy). That yields a basis for the emergence of hate between the frozen opposed blocks.","Sun, 25 Jun 2023 20:38:43 UTC (330 KB)"

Providing budgeting processes for improving quality of life based on objective (data-driven) evidence has been so far a missing element in policy-making. This paper focuses on a case study of 1,204 citizens in the city of Aarau, Switzerland, and analyzes survey data containing insightful indicators that can impact the legitimacy of decision-making. Our approach is twofold. On the one hand, we aim to optimize the legitimacy of policymakers' decisions by identifying the level of investment in neighborhoods and projects that offer the greatest return in legitimacy. To do so, we introduce a new context-independent legitimacy metric for policymakers. This metric allows us to distinguish decisive vs. indecisive collective preferences for neighborhoods or projects on which to invest, enabling policymakers to prioritize impactful bottom-up consultations and participatory initiatives (e.g., participatory budgeting). The metric also allows policymakers to identify the optimal number of investments in various project sectors and neighborhoods (in terms of legitimacy gain). On the other hand, we aim to offer guidance to policymakers concerning which satisfaction and participation factors influence citizens' quality of life through an accurate classification model and an evaluation of relocations. By doing so, policymakers may be able to further refine their strategy, making targeted investments with significant benefits to citizens' quality of life. These findings are expected to provide transformative insights for practicing direct democracy in Switzerland and a blueprint for policy-making to adopt worldwide.","Fri, 23 Jun 2023 13:38:39 UTC (17,247 KB)"

Often the goal is not to favor a certain side of a conflict but to increase disagreement and polarization. To get a mathematical understanding of such attacks, researchers use opinion-formation models from sociology, such as the Friedkin--Johnsen model, and formally study how much discord the adversary can produce when altering the opinions for only a small set of users. In this line of work, it is commonly assumed that the adversary has full knowledge about the network topology and the opinions of all users. However, the latter assumption is often unrealistic in practice, where user opinions are not available or simply difficult to estimate accurately.
To address this concern, we raise the following question: Can an attacker sow discord in a social network, even when only the network topology is known? We answer this question affirmatively. We present approximation algorithms for detecting a small set of users who are highly influential for the disagreement and polarization in the network. We show that when the adversary radicalizes these users and if the initial disagreement/polarization in the network is not very high, then our method gives a constant-factor approximation on the setting when the user opinions are known. To find the set of influential users, we provide a novel approximation algorithm for a variant of MaxCut in graphs with positive and negative edge weights. We experimentally evaluate our methods, which have access only to the network topology, and we find that they have similar performance as methods that have access to the network topology and all user opinions. We further present an NP-hardness proof, which was an open question by Chen and Racz [IEEE Trans. Netw. Sci. Eng., 2021].","Sat, 17 Jun 2023 10:32:02 UTC (2,392 KB)[v2] Tue, 12 Sep 2023 19:05:59 UTC (2,405 KB)"

Moreover, the process has proven to be deceptive, with repeated dramatic failures. To address the issue I suggest a mirror simple model to mimic the process at stake. The model considers a collection of ground items which are labelled either Terrorist Connected (TC) or Terrorist Free (TF). To extract the signal from the ground data items I implement an iterated coarse-grained scheme, which yields a giant unique item with a label TC or TF. The results obtained validate the processing scheme with correct outcomes for the full range of proportions of TC items, beside in a specific sub-range. There, a systematic wrong labelling of the giant item is obtained at the benefit of WT, who are wrongly labeled not would-be terrorist (NWT). This flaw proves to be irremovable because it is anchored within the processing itself in connexion with the treatment of uncertain aggregates, which inevitable appear. The ``natural"" allocation of uncertain aggregates to the TF label, in tune with the ethical application of the presumption of innocence in force in democracies, confines the wrong diagnosis systematically to the benefit of some WT, who are labelled NWT. It happens that applying the presumption of guilt, instead of that of innocence, to label the indeterminate aggregates, shifts the systematic errors to another sub-range of proportions of TC items with then zero errors in identifying a WT. But instead, some NWT are wrongly labeled WT. Despite of being quite far from reality, my results suggest that intelligence agencies should investigate the overall effect of seemingly inconsequential ""natural"" labelling, which are applied locally when data are uncertain with no immediate detectable impact on the data processing.","Mon, 12 Jun 2023 21:01:30 UTC (1,111 KB)"

We establish that liquid democracy admits equilibria which improve welfare and information aggregation over direct and representative democracy when voters' preferences and information precisions are publicly or privately known. Liquid democracy also admits equilibria which do worse than the other two systems.

Yet most of the existing methods for detecting partisan gerrymandering are narrowly tailored toward fully contested two-party elections, and fail if there are more parties or if the number of candidates per district varies (as is the case in many plurality-based electoral systems outside the United States). We propose two methods, based on nonparametric statistical learning, that are able to deal with such cases. The use of multiple methods makes the proposed solution robust against violation of their respective assumptions.

This paper investigates the socio-political implications of governmental online targeting, using a case study of the UK government's application of such techniques for public policy objectives. We argue that this practice undermines democratic ideals, as it engenders three primary concerns -- Transparency, Privacy, and Equality -- that clash with fundamental democratic doctrines and values. To address these concerns, the paper introduces a preliminary blueprint for an AI governance framework that harmonizes governmental use of online targeting with certain democratic principles. Furthermore, we advocate for the creation of an independent, non-governmental regulatory body responsible for overseeing the process and monitoring the government's use of online targeting, a critical measure for preserving democratic values.","Fri, 2 Jun 2023 12:07:17 UTC (33 KB)"

Election forensics tools are used to identify statistical traces of certain types of electoral fraud, providing important information about the integrity and validity of democratic elections. Such analyses of the 2017 and 2018 Turkish elections revealed that malpractices such as ballot stuffing or voter manipulation may indeed have played a significant role in determining the election results. Here, we apply election forensic statistical tests for ballot stuffing and voter manipulation to the results of the 2023 presidential election in Turkey. We find that both rounds of the 2023 presidential election exhibit similar statistical irregularities to those observed in the 2018 presidential election, however the magnitude of these distortions has decreased. We estimate that 2.4% (SD 1.9%) and 1.9% (SD 1.7%) of electoral units may have been affected by ballot stuffing practices in favour of Erdogan in the first and second rounds, respectively, compared to 8.5% (SD 3.9%) in 2018. Areas with smaller polling stations and fewer ballot boxes had significantly inflated votes and turnout, again, in favor of Erdogan. Furthermore, electoral districts with two or fewer ballot boxes were more likely to show large swings in vote shares in favour of Erdogan from the first to the second round. Based on a statistical model, we estimate that these swings translate into 342,000 excess votes (SD 4,900) or 0.64% for Erdogan. Our results suggest that Turkish elections continue to be riddled with statistical irregularities, that may be indicative of electoral fraud.","Tue, 30 May 2023 16:14:56 UTC (369 KB)[v2] Sun, 25 Jun 2023 09:19:08 UTC (822 KB)"

We utilize heuristics to identify coordinated inauthentic accounts and detect attitudes, concerns and emotions within their tweets, collectively known as socio-linguistic characteristics. We find that coordinated accounts retweet other coordinated accounts far more than expected by chance, while being exceptionally active just before the second round of voting. Concurrently, socio-linguistic characteristics reveal that coordinated accounts share tweets promoting a candidate at three times the rate of non-coordinated accounts. Coordinated account tactics also varied in time to reflect news events and rounds of voting. Our analysis highlights the utility of socio-linguistic characteristics to inform researchers about tactics of coordinated accounts and how these may feed into online social manipulation.","Fri, 19 May 2023 17:58:22 UTC (4,101 KB)[v2] Tue, 30 May 2023 20:38:29 UTC (4,072 KB)"

Social media and blogs have allowed citizens of these countries to find a way to communicate, and the exchange of information continues to rise. The quest by both authoritarian and democratic regimes to control or influence the discussion in the public sphere has given rise to concepts like cybertroopers, congressional bloggers, and commentator bloggers, among others. Cybertroopers have become the de facto online soldiers of authoritarian regimes who must embrace democracy. While commentator and congressional bloggers have acted with different strategies, commentator bloggers educate online citizens with knowledgeable information to influence the citizens. Congressional bloggers are political officeholders who use blogging to communicate their positions on ongoing national issues. Therefore, this work has explored various concepts synonymous with the Indo-Pacific public sphere and how it shapes elections and democracy.","Sun, 9 Apr 2023 00:12:15 UTC (957 KB)[v2] Tue, 11 Apr 2023 00:50:51 UTC (937 KB)"

However, a unified framework to analyze and compare different selection mechanisms is missing, resulting in very few comparative works. To address this gap, we advocate employing concepts and tools from computational social choice in order to devise a model in which different selection mechanisms can be formalized. Such a model would allow for desirable representation axioms to be conceptualized and evaluated. We make the first step in this direction by proposing a unifying mathematical formulation of different selection mechanisms as well as various social-choice-inspired axioms such as proportionality and monotonicity.","Wed, 5 Apr 2023 22:28:32 UTC (34 KB)"

First, I propose a definition for societal-scale technology and locate LLMs within this definition. Next, I argue that existing processes to ensure the safety of LLMs are insufficient and do not give the systems democratic legitimacy. Instead, we require processes of deliberation amongst users and other stakeholders on questions about the safety of outputs and deployment contexts. This shift in AI safety research and practice will require the design of corporate and public policies that determine how to enact deliberation and the design of interfaces and technical features to translate the outcomes of deliberation into technical development processes. To conclude, I propose roles for the HCI community to ensure deliberative processes inform technology and policy design for LLMs and other societal-scale technology.","Mon, 20 Mar 2023 02:27:52 UTC (104 KB)[v2] Mon, 27 Mar 2023 04:47:19 UTC (104 KB)"

While professional fact-checkers form the first line of defense by fact-checking popular false claims, they do not engage directly in conversations with misinformation spreaders. On the other hand, non-expert ordinary users act as eyes-on-the-ground who proactively counter misinformation -- recent research has shown that 96% counter-misinformation responses are made by ordinary users. However, research also found that 2/3 times, these responses are rude and lack evidence. This work seeks to create a counter-misinformation response generation model to empower users to effectively correct misinformation. This objective is challenging due to the absence of datasets containing ground-truth of ideal counter-misinformation responses, and the lack of models that can generate responses backed by communication theories. In this work, we create two novel datasets of misinformation and counter-misinformation response pairs from in-the-wild social media and crowdsourcing from college-educated students. We annotate the collected data to distinguish poor from ideal responses that are factual, polite, and refute misinformation. We propose MisinfoCorrect, a reinforcement learning-based framework that learns to generate counter-misinformation responses for an input misinformation post. The model rewards the generator to increase the politeness, factuality, and refutation attitude while retaining text fluency and relevancy. Quantitative and qualitative evaluation shows that our model outperforms several baselines by generating high-quality counter-responses. This work illustrates the promise of generative text models for social good -- here, to help create a safe and reliable information ecosystem.

A unit of voting power is publicly represented by the Merkle root of a tree consisting of its latest owner's public key, a random nonce and the Merkle root of the tree of its previous owner's public key and random nonce and so on. A transition includes the input units, their owner's public keys and signatures, the hashes of their nonces and the output units generated with the new owners' public keys and random nonces. In case of a delegation, the receiver provides the sender with the hashed random nonces and hashed public keys for the output units. In case of a transfer, only the precomputed output units are provided by the receiver. In a reversal, a historical owner reveals the hashes of the nonces and public keys that resulted in the subsequent units.

Although these systems are a classical research topic, knowledge is still limited regarding the public opinion about these systems. Public opinion is also important because the systems are known to cause various problems. To this end, this paper presents a qualitative analysis of the perceptions of ordinary citizens, civil society groups, businesses, and others on recommender systems in Europe. The dataset examined is based on the answers submitted to a consultation about the Digital Services Act (DSA) recently enacted in the European Union (EU). Therefore, not only does the paper contribute to the pressing question about regulating new technologies and online platforms, but it also reveals insights about the policy-making of the DSA. According to the qualitative results, Europeans have generally negative opinions about recommender systems and the quality of their recommendations. The systems are widely seen to violate privacy and other fundamental rights. According to many Europeans, these also cause various societal problems, including even threats to democracy. Furthermore, existing regulations in the EU are commonly seen to have failed due to a lack of proper enforcement. Numerous suggestions were made by the respondents to the consultation for improving the situation, but only a few of these ended up to the DSA.","Mon, 20 Feb 2023 11:57:12 UTC (70 KB)[v2] Fri, 15 Sep 2023 02:40:42 UTC (71 KB)[v3] Wed, 25 Oct 2023 04:59:02 UTC (73 KB)[v4] Wed, 1 Nov 2023 06:20:52 UTC (75 KB)"
"82","Beyond Transactional Democracy: A Study of Civic Tech in Canada","Curtis W McCord, Christoph Becker","Computers and Society (cs.CY)","Abstract:Technologies are increasingly enrolled in projects to involve civilians in the work of policy-making, often under the label of 'civic technology'. But conventional forms of participation through transactions such as voting provide limited opportunities for engagement. In response, some civic tech groups organize around issues of shared concern to explore new forms of democratic technologies. How does their work affect the relationship between publics and public servants?
This paper explores how a Civic Tech Toronto creates a platform for civic engagement through the maintenance of an autonomous community for civic engagement and participation that is casual, social, nonpartisan, experimental, and flexible. Based on two years of action research, including community organizing, interviews, and observations, this paper shows how this grassroots civic tech group creates a civic platform that places a diverse range of participants in contact with the work of public servants, helping to build capacities and relationships that prepare both publics and public servants for the work of participatory democracy.
The case shows that understanding civic tech requires a lens beyond the mere analysis or production of technical artifacts. As a practice for making technologies that is social and participatory, civic tech creates alternative modes of technology development and opportunities for experimentation and learning, and it can reconfigure the roles of democratic participants.","Mon, 13 Feb 2023 19:31:13 UTC (15,572 KB)"
"83","Auditing Recommender Systems -- Putting the DSA into practice with a risk-scenario-based approach","Anna-Katharina Meßmer, Martin Degeling","Computers and Society (cs.CY)","Abstract:Today's online platforms rely heavily on recommendation systems to serve content to their users; social media is a prime example. In turn, recommendation systems largely depend on artificial intelligence algorithms to decide who gets to see what. While the content social media platforms deliver is as varied as the users who engage with them, it has been shown that platforms can contribute to serious harm to individuals, groups and societies. Studies have suggested that these negative impacts range from worsening an individual's mental health to driving society-wide polarisation capable of putting democracies at risk. To better safeguard people from these harms, the European Union's Digital Services Act (DSA) requires platforms, especially those with large numbers of users, to make their algorithmic systems more transparent and follow due diligence obligations. These requirements constitute an important legislative step towards mitigating the systemic risks posed by online platforms. However, the DSA lacks concrete guidelines to operationalise a viable audit process that would allow auditors to hold these platforms accountable. This void could foster the spread of 'audit-washing', that is, platforms exploiting audits to legitimise their practices and neglect responsibility.
To fill this gap, we propose a risk-scenario-based audit process. We explain in detail what audits and assessments of recommender systems according to the DSA should look like. Our approach also considers the evolving nature of platforms and emphasises the observability of their recommender systems' components. The resulting audit facilitates internal (among audits of the same system at different moments in time) and external comparability (among audits of different platforms) while also affording the evaluation of mitigation measures implemented by the platforms themselves.","Thu, 9 Feb 2023 10:48:37 UTC (1,757 KB)"

""Collective response systems"" are a type of generative collective intelligence (CI) facilitation process meant to address this challenge. They enable a form of ""generative voting"", where both the votes, and the choices of what to vote on, are provided by the group. Such systems overcome the traditional limitations of polling, town halls, standard voting, referendums, etc. The generative CI outputs of collective response systems can also be chained together into iterative ""collective dialogues"", analogously to some kinds of generative AI.
Technical advances across domains including recommender systems, language models, and human-computer interaction have led to the development of innovative and scalable collective response systems. For example, Polis has been used around the world to support policy-making at different levels of government, and Remesh has been used by the UN to understand the challenges and needs of ordinary people across war-torn countries. This paper aims to develop a shared language by defining the structure, processes, properties, and principles of such systems.
Collective response systems allow non-confrontational exploration of divisive issues, help identify common ground, and elicit insights from those closest to the issues. As a result, they can help overcome gridlock around conflict and governance challenges, increase trust, and develop mandates. Continued progress toward their development and adoption could help revitalize democracies, reimagine corporate governance, transform conflict, and govern powerful AI systems -- both as a complement to deeper deliberative democratic processes and as an option where deeper processes are not applicable or possible.","Wed, 1 Feb 2023 18:59:02 UTC (15 KB)"

Typically, these representation learning approaches embed the networks into a low-dimensional space in which the role of each individual can be characterized in terms of their latent position. A major current concern in social networks is the emergence of polarization and filter bubbles promoting a mindset of ""us-versus-them"" that may be defined by extreme positions believed to ultimately lead to political violence and the erosion of democracy. Such polarized networks are typically characterized in terms of signed links reflecting likes and dislikes. We propose the latent Signed relational Latent dIstance Model (SLIM) utilizing for the first time the Skellam distribution as a likelihood function for signed networks and extend the modeling to the characterization of distinct extreme positions by constraining the embedding space to polytopes. On four real social signed networks of polarization, we demonstrate that the model extracts low-dimensional characterizations that well predict friendships and animosity while providing interpretable visualizations defined by extreme positions when endowing the model with an embedding space restricted to polytopes.","Mon, 23 Jan 2023 16:01:26 UTC (12,469 KB)[v2] Sat, 28 Jan 2023 14:26:50 UTC (12,469 KB)[v3] Fri, 3 Mar 2023 14:30:23 UTC (19,444 KB)"

Shepherd","Human-Computer Interaction (cs.HC)","Abstract:Over the past decade, the media landscape has seen a radical shift. As more of the public stay informed of current events via online sources, competition has grown as outlets vie for attention. This competition has prompted some online outlets to publish sensationalist and alarmist content to grab readers' attention. Such practices may threaten democracy by distorting the truth and misleading readers about the nature of events. This paper proposes a novel system for detecting, processing, and warning users about misleading content online to combat the threats posed by misinformation. By training a machine learning model on an existing dataset of 32,000 clickbait news article headlines, the model predicts how sensationalist a headline is and then interfaces with a web browser extension which constructs a unique content warning notification based on existing design principles and incorporates the models' prediction. This research makes a novel contribution to machine learning and human-centred security with promising findings for future research. By warning users when they may be viewing misinformation, it is possible to prevent spontaneous reactions, helping users to take a deep breath and approach online media with a clear mind.","Mon, 9 Jan 2023 12:43:58 UTC (6,482 KB)"

Along with this growth in internet access is the risk of cyberattacks to vulnerable IoT devices mushrooming in the African cyberspace. One way to determine IoT vulnerabilities is to find open ports within Africa s cyberspace. Our research leverages Shodan search engine, a powerful tool for discovering IoT devices facing the public internet, to find open ports across Africa. We conduct an analysis of our findings, ranking countries from most to least vulnerable to cyberattack. We find that South Africa,Tunisia, Morocco, Egypt, and Nigeria are the five countries most susceptible to cyberattack on the continent. Further, 69.8% of devices having one of the five most commonly open internet ports have had past documented vulnerabilities. Following our analysis, we conclude with policy recommendations for both the public and private sector.","Sun, 8 Jan 2023 10:00:11 UTC (1,623 KB)"

We develop a constrained Bayesian grouped estimator that exploits researchers' prior beliefs on groups in a form of pairwise constraints, indicating whether a pair of units is likely to belong to a same group or different groups. We propose a prior to incorporate the pairwise constraints with varying degrees of confidence. The whole framework is built on the nonparametric Bayesian method, which implicitly specifies a distribution over the group partitions, and so the posterior analysis takes the uncertainty of the latent group structure into account. Monte Carlo experiments reveal that adding prior knowledge yields more accurate estimates of coefficient and scores predictive gains over alternative estimators. We apply our method to two empirical applications. In a first application to forecasting U.S. CPI inflation, we illustrate that prior knowledge of groups improves density forecasts when the data is not entirely informative. A second application revisits the relationship between a country's income and its democratic transition; we identify heterogeneous income effects on democracy with five distinct groups over ninety countries.","Wed, 30 Nov 2022 03:32:58 UTC (25,611 KB)[v2] Wed, 29 Mar 2023 17:11:04 UTC (27,226 KB)[v3] Sat, 28 Oct 2023 18:46:34 UTC (27,227 KB)"

This democratic ideal can be undermined when candidates are dishonest when campaigning for election over these multiple cycles or rounds of voting. Much of the work on COMSOC to date has investigated strategic actions in only a single round. We introduce a novel formal model of \emph{pandering}, or strategic preference reporting by candidates seeking to be elected, and examine the resilience of two democratic voting systems to pandering within a single round and across multiple rounds. The two voting systems we compare are Representative Democracy (RD) and Flexible Representative Democracy (FRD). For each voting system, our analysis centers on the types of strategies candidates employ and how voters update their views of candidates based on how the candidates have pandered in the past. We provide theoretical results on the complexity of pandering in our setting for a single cycle, formulate our problem for multiple cycles as a Markov Decision Process, and use reinforcement learning to study the effects of pandering by both single candidates and groups of candidates across a number of rounds.","Fri, 18 Nov 2022 02:19:28 UTC (593 KB)[v2] Fri, 24 Feb 2023 16:52:13 UTC (916 KB)"

The conventional technology of ""permissive meeting analysis"" derives a consensusable choice that falls within everyone's permissible range through mathematical analyses; however, it tends to be biased toward the majority in a group, making it difficult to reach a consensus when a conflict arises. To support consensus building (defined here as an acceptable compromise that not everyone rejects), we developed a composite consensus-building process. The developed process addresses this issue by combining permissible meeting analysis with a new ""compromise choice-exploration"" technology, which presents a consensusable choice that emphasizes fairness and equality among everyone when permissible meeting analysis fails to do so. When both permissible meeting analysis and compromise choice exploration do not arrive at a consensus, a facility is provided to create a sublated choice among those provided by them. The trial experimental results confirmed that permissive meeting analysis and compromise choice exploration are sufficiently useful for deriving consensusable choices. Furthermore, we found that compromise choice exploration is characterized by its ability to derive choices that control the balance between compromise and fairness. Our proposed composite consensus-building approach could be applied in a wide range of situations, from local issues in municipalities and communities to international issues such as environmental protection and human rights issues. It could also aid in developing digital democracy and platform cooperativism.","Wed, 16 Nov 2022 00:49:01 UTC (565 KB)"

After the apparent triumph of liberal democracies at the end of the twentieth century, Francis Fukuyama and others have been arguing that humankind is approaching an `end of history' (EoH) in the form of a universality of liberal democracies. This view has been challenged by recent developments that seem to indicate the rise of defective democracies across the globe. There has been no attempt to quantify the expected EoH with a statistical approach. In this study, we model the transition between political regimes as a Markov process and -- using a Bayesian inference approach -- we estimate the transition probabilities between political regimes from time-series data describing the evolution of political regimes from 1800--2018. We then compute the steady state for this Markov process which represents a mathematical abstraction of the EoH and predicts that approximately 46 % of countries will be full democracies. Furthermore, we find that, under our model, the fraction of autocracies in the world is expected to increase for the next half-century before it declines. Using random-walk theory, we then estimate survival curves of different types of regimes and estimate characteristic lifetimes of democracies and autocracies of 244 years and 69 years, respectively. Quantifying the expected EoH allows us to challenge common beliefs about the nature of political equilibria. Specifically, we find no statistical evidence that the EoH constitutes a fixed, complete omnipresence of democratic regimes.","Thu, 3 Nov 2022 16:40:04 UTC (4,442 KB)"

Siegenfeld, Andrew Gelman","Applications (stat.AP)","Abstract:Democracies employ elections at various scales to select officials at the corresponding levels of administration. The geographical distribution of political opinion, the policy issues delegated to each level, and the multilevel interactions between elections can all greatly impact the makeup of these representative bodies. This perspective is not new: the adoption of federal systems has been motivated by the idea that they possess desirable traits not provided by democracies on a single scale. Yet most existing models of polarization do not capture how nested local and national elections interact with heterogeneous political geographies. We begin by developing a framework to describe the multilevel distribution of opinions and analyze the flow of variance among geographic scales, applying it to historical data in the United States from 1912 to 2020. We describe how unstable elections can arise due to the spatial distribution of opinions and how tradeoffs occur between national and local elections. We also examine multi-dimensional spaces of political opinion, for which we show that a decrease in local salience can constrain the dimensions along which elections occur, preventing a federal system from serving as an effective safeguard against polarization. These analyses, based on the interactions between elections and opinion distributions at various scales, offer insights into how democracies can be strengthened to mitigate polarization and increase electoral representation.","Wed, 2 Nov 2022 16:30:51 UTC (6,763 KB)"

This paper presents empirical evidence of multicoalition democracy in DAO and further contributes to the contemporary debate on whether decentralized governance is possible.","Thu, 20 Oct 2022 12:27:41 UTC (2,123 KB)[v2] Fri, 20 Jan 2023 13:41:57 UTC (2,267 KB)[v3] Wed, 1 Mar 2023 20:03:26 UTC (2,323 KB)[v4] Mon, 19 Jun 2023 13:21:50 UTC (1,171 KB)"

Apparently, it will be getting more and more critical because of increasing speeds and scales of electronic communications and decreasing latencies in system responses. In order to address this need, we present design and implementation of a reputation system supporting ""liquid democracy"" principle. The system is based on ""weighted liquid rank"" algorithm employing different sorts of explicit and implicit ratings being exchanged by members of the society as well as implicit assessments of of the members based on measures of their activity in the society. The system is evaluated against live social network data with help of simulation modelling for an online marketplace case.","Wed, 5 Oct 2022 15:57:49 UTC (531 KB)"
"102","Generalizing Liquid Democracy to multi-agent delegation: A Voting Power Measure and Equilibrium Analysis","Francisco M. Bersetche","Multiagent Systems (cs.MA)","Abstract:Liquid democracy has gained popularity in recent years due to its ability to balance representation and delegation of power. In this work, we propose a generalization of the classic model that allows for fractional delegation of voting weight. Our approach enables agents to divide and delegate their votes to multiple agents, while retaining a portion of the voting power for themselves. We discuss the desirable properties of a reasonable generalization of the classic model and introduce a set of simpler voting measures that include a penalty factor on the length of delegation chains. We demonstrate that the proposed voting measure is a well-defined limit of these simpler measures when the penalty approaches zero, and inherits key features of the classic model. In the second part of the article, we investigate the existence of equilibrium states in a delegation game that employs the suggested measures. We show that this game has pure strategy Nash equilibria as long as a penalty on the length of delegation chains is enforced.","Wed, 28 Sep 2022 14:25:36 UTC (19 KB)[v2] Mon, 24 Apr 2023 18:50:42 UTC (29 KB)"
"103","How GPT-3 responds to different publics on climate change and Black Lives Matter: A critical appraisal of equity in conversational AI","Kaiping Chen, Anqi Shao, Jirayu Burapacheep, Yixuan Li","Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI)","Abstract:Autoregressive language models, which use deep learning to produce human-like texts, have become increasingly widespread. Such models are powering popular virtual assistants in areas like smart health, finance, and autonomous driving. While the parameters of these large language models are improving, concerns persist that these models might not work equally for all subgroups in society. Despite growing discussions of AI fairness across disciplines, there lacks systemic metrics to assess what equity means in dialogue systems and how to engage different populations in the assessment loop. Grounded in theories of deliberative democracy and science and technology studies, this paper proposes an analytical framework for unpacking the meaning of equity in human-AI dialogues. Using this framework, we conducted an auditing study to examine how GPT-3 responded to different sub-populations on crucial science and social topics: climate change and the Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement. Our corpus consists of over 20,000 rounds of dialogues between GPT-3 and 3290 individuals who vary in gender, race and ethnicity, education level, English as a first language, and opinions toward the issues. We found a substantively worse user experience with GPT-3 among the opinion and the education minority subpopulations; however, these two groups achieved the largest knowledge gain, changing attitudes toward supporting BLM and climate change efforts after the chat. We traced these user experience divides to conversational differences and found that GPT-3 used more negative expressions when it responded to the education and opinion minority groups, compared to its responses to the majority groups. We discuss the implications of our findings for a deliberative conversational AI system that centralizes diversity, equity, and inclusion.","Tue, 27 Sep 2022 18:44:41 UTC (1,360 KB)[v2] Tue, 14 Mar 2023 21:47:37 UTC (487 KB)"

In this paper, we propose a model to implement the liquid democracy principle for the content recommendation system. It uses a personalized recommendation model based on reputation ranking system to encourage personal interests driven recommendation. Moreover, the personalization factors to an end users' higher-order friends on the social network (initial input Twitter channels in our case study) to improve the accuracy and diversity of recommendation results. This paper analyzes the dataset based on cryptocurrency news on Twitter to find the opinion leader using the liquid rank reputation system. This paper deals with the tier-2 implementation of a liquid rank in a content recommendation model. This model can be also used as an additional layer in the other recommendation systems.

Earlier research on the impact of media bias has revealed their strong impact on opinions and preferences. Responsible NRs are supposed to have depolarizing capacities, once they go beyond accuracy measures. We performed sequence prediction by using the BERT4Rec algorithm to investigate the interplay of news of coverage and user behavior. Based on live data and training of a large data set from one news outlet ""event bursts"", ""rally around the flag"" effect and ""filter bubbles"" were investigated in our interdisciplinary approach between data science and psychology. Potentials for fair NRs that go beyond accuracy measures are outlined via training of the models with a large data set of articles, keywords, and user behavior. The development of the news coverage and user behavior of the COVID-19 pandemic from primarily medical to broader political content and debates was traced. Our study provides first insights for future development of responsible news recommendation that acknowledges user preferences while stimulating diversity and accountability instead of accuracy, only.","Thu, 15 Sep 2022 21:10:11 UTC (1,030 KB)"

In particular, we are interested in fine-grained liquid democracy, meaning that voters are able to designate a partial coin to a set of election options and delegate the decision on how to further split this partial coin among those election options to another voter of her choice. The fact that we wish such delegations to be transitive -- combined with our aim at fully respecting such delegations -- means that inconsistencies and cycles can occur, thus we set to find computationally-efficient ways of resolving voter delegations. To this aim we develop a theory based fixed-point theorems and mathematical programming techniques and we show that for various variants of definitions regarding how to resolve such transitive delegations, there is always a feasible resolution; and we identify under which conditions such solutions are efficiently computable.","Tue, 30 Aug 2022 17:58:08 UTC (20 KB)"

The role of political leaders in this process has attracted less research attention, even though politicians who ""speak their mind"" are perceived by segments of the public as authentic and honest even if their statements are unsupported by evidence. Analyzing communications by members of the U.S. Congress on Twitter between 2011 and 2022, we show that politicians' conception of honesty has undergone a distinct shift, with authentic belief-speaking that may be decoupled from evidence becoming more prominent and more differentiated from explicitly evidence-based truth seeking. We show that for Republicans - but not Democrats - an increase of belief-speaking of 10% is associated with a decrease of 12.8 points of quality (NewsGuard scoring system) in the sources shared in a tweet. Conversely, an increase in truth-seeking language is associated with an increase in quality of sources for both parties. The results support the hypothesis that the current dissemination of misinformation in political discourse is in part driven by an alternative understanding of truth and honesty that emphasizes invocation of subjective belief at the expense of reliance on evidence.","Tue, 23 Aug 2022 08:59:32 UTC (1,940 KB)[v2] Tue, 13 Dec 2022 17:23:26 UTC (7,681 KB)[v3] Wed, 14 Jun 2023 15:51:37 UTC (5,163 KB)"

A party with a strong electoral base can benefit from using a binding referendum to resolve issues that divide its core supporters. When referendums do not bind, however, an electorally disadvantaged party may initiate a referendum to elevate new issues in order to divide the supporters of its stronger opponent. We identify conditions under which direct democracy improves congruence between policy outcomes and voter preferences, but also show that it can lead to greater misalignment both on issues subject to direct democracy and those that are not.","Wed, 10 Aug 2022 19:43:10 UTC (329 KB)"

In this paper, we investigate the topic of democratization in the context of QT, particularly quantum computing. The paper contains three main sections. First, we briefly introduce different theories of democracy (participatory, representative, and deliberative) and how the concept of democratization can be formulated with respect to whether democracy is taken as an intrinsic or instrumental value. Second, we give an overview of how the concept of democratization is used in the QT field. Democratization is mainly adopted by companies working on quantum computing and used in a very narrow understanding of the concept. Third, we explore various narratives and counter-narratives concerning democratization in QT. Finally, we explore the general efforts of democratization in QT such as different forms of access, formation of grassroot communities and special interest groups, the emerging culture of manifesto writing, and how these can be located within the different theories of democracy. In conclusion, we argue that although the ongoing efforts in the democratization of QT are necessary steps towards the democratization of this set of emerging technologies, they should not be accepted as sufficient to argue that QT is a democratized field. We argue that more reflexivity and responsiveness regarding the narratives and actions adopted by the actors in the QT field, and making the underlying assumptions of ongoing efforts on democratization of QT explicit, can result in a better technology for society.","Fri, 5 Aug 2022 19:23:09 UTC (385 KB)[v2] Tue, 9 Aug 2022 07:50:49 UTC (385 KB)[v3] Wed, 30 Nov 2022 11:25:00 UTC (416 KB)"

Grenoble Alpes, (2) CNRS, (3) Grenoble INP, (4) LIG, (5) GAEL)","Computers and Society (cs.CY)","Abstract:Facebook and other advertising platforms exploit users data for marketing purposes by allowing advertisers to select specific users and target them (the practice is being called micro-targeting). However, advertisers such as Cambridge Analytica have maliciously used these targeting features to manipulate users in the context of elections. The European Commission plans to restrict or ban some targeting functionalities in the new European Democracy Action Plan act to protect users from such harms. The difficulty is that we do not know the economic impact of these restrictions on regular advertisers. In this paper, to inform the debate, we take a first step by understanding who is advertising on Facebook and how they use the targeting functionalities. For this, we asked 890 U.S. users to install a monitoring tool on their browsers to collect the ads they receive on Facebook and information about how these ads were targeted. By matching advertisers on Facebook with their LinkedIn profiles, we could see that 71% of advertisers are small and medium-sized businesses with 200 employees or less, and they are responsible for 61% of ads and 57% of ad impressions. Regarding micro-targeting, we found that only 32% of small and medium-sized businesses and 30% of large-sized businesses micro-target at least one of their ads. These results should not be interpreted as micro-targeting not being useful as a marketing strategy, but rather that advertisers prefer to outsource the micro-targeting task to ad platforms. Indeed, Facebook is employing optimization algorithms that exploit user data to decide which users should see what ads; which means ad platforms are performing an algorithmic-driven micro-targeting. Hence, when setting restrictions, legislators should take into account both the traditional advertiser-driven micro-targeting as well as algorithmic-driven micro-targeting performed by ad platforms.","Tue, 19 Jul 2022 14:16:54 UTC (1,672 KB)[v2] Sat, 2 Mar 2024 18:18:43 UTC (1,528 KB)"

Not only are traditional voting methods mediocre in terms of convenience and interface, they also encompass principal-agent problem, where the state may have vested interest in the outcome of the ballot. Electronic voting protocol using cryptography to deliver in zero trust environments is long overdue. Here I propose using Proof of Work algorithm at user devices in combination with other well-known security primitives to build a zero-trust voting system. The state would only issue single-use voting authorizations to its citizens, while zero trust design would allow conducting elections by an open-source platform with enhanced observability. It is also hypothesized that the heighten availability of plebiscite by means of the proposed design may ultimately change the way our society participates in the policy making.","Thu, 30 Jun 2022 11:52:45 UTC (321 KB)"

Because information disseminated by political elites is known to shape citizen and media discourse, it is particularly important to examine the quality of information shared by politicians. Here we show that from 2016 onward, members of the Republican party in the U.S. Congress have been increasingly sharing links to untrustworthy sources. The proportion of untrustworthy information posted by Republicans versus Democrats is diverging at an accelerating rate, and this divergence has worsened since president Biden was elected. This divergence between parties seems to be unique to the U.S. as it cannot be observed in other western democracies such as Germany and the United Kingdom, where left-right disparities are smaller and have remained largely constant.","Wed, 13 Jul 2022 16:03:47 UTC (3,185 KB)"

"116","A Contribution to the Defense of Liquid Democracy","Gregory Butterworth, Richard Booth","Multiagent Systems (cs.MA)","Abstract:Liquid democracy is a hybrid direct-representative decision making process that provides each voter with the option of either voting directly or to delegate their vote to another voter, i.e., to a representative of their choice. One of the proposed advantages of liquid democracy is that, in general, it is assumed that voters will delegate their vote to others that are better informed, which leads to more informed and better decisions. Considering an audience from various knowledge domains, we provide an accessible high-level analysis of a prominent critique of liquid democracy by Caragiannis and Micha. Caragiannis and Micha's critique contains three central topics: 1. Analysis using their $\alpha$-delegation model, which does not assume delegation to the more informed; 2. Novel delegation network structures where it is advantageous to delegate to the less informed rather than the more informed; and 3. Due to NP hardness, the implied impracticability of a social network obtaining an optimal delegation structure. We show that in the real world, Caragiannis and Micha's critique of liquid democracy has little or no relevance. Respectively, our critique is based on: 1. The identification of incorrect $\alpha$-delegation model assumptions; 2. A lack of novel delegation structures and their effect in a real-world implementation of liquid democracy, which would be guaranteed with constraints that sensibly distribute voting power; and 3. The irrelevance of an optimal delegation structure if the correct result is guaranteed regardless. We conclude that Caragiannis and Micha's critique has no significant negative relevance to the proposition of liquid democracy.","Tue, 28 Jun 2022 11:40:28 UTC (173 KB)[v2] Thu, 3 Aug 2023 12:28:39 UTC (41 KB)"

This makes it a challenge for FL to alleviate the single point of failure and dishonest clients. These impending challenges in the design philosophy of FL call for blockchain-based federated learning (BFL) due to the benefits of coupling FL and blockchain (e.g., democracy, incentive, and immutability). However, one problem in vanilla BFL is that its capabilities do not follow adopters' needs in a dynamic fashion. Besides, vanilla BFL relies on unverifiable clients' self-reported contributions like data size because checking clients' raw data is not allowed in FL for privacy concerns. We design and evaluate a novel BFL framework, and resolve the identified challenges in vanilla BFL with greater flexibility and incentive mechanism called FAIR-BFL. In contrast to existing works, FAIR-BFL offers unprecedented flexibility via the modular design, allowing adopters to adjust its capabilities following business demands in a dynamic fashion. Our design accounts for BFL's ability to quantify each client's contribution to the global learning process. Such quantification provides a rational metric for distributing the rewards among federated clients and helps discover malicious participants that may poison the global model.","Sun, 26 Jun 2022 15:20:45 UTC (833 KB)"

These quantities are closely related, but their connection is hidden by the use of four different vector fields for their representation, namely, the electric and magnetic fields $\mathbf{E}$ and $\mathbf{B}$, and the two transverse potential vectors $\mathbf{C}^\perp$ and $\mathbf{A}^\perp$. Helmholtz's decomposition theorem restricted to solenoidal vector fields, entails the introduction of a bona fide inverse curl operator, which permits one to express the above three quantities in terms of the observable electric and magnetic fields only. This yields clear expressions for $H, C$, and $\mathbf{S}$, which are automatically gauge-invariant and display electric-magnetic democracy.","Fri, 17 Jun 2022 14:45:48 UTC (27 KB)[v2] Fri, 28 Oct 2022 14:51:27 UTC (19 KB)"

In its simplest form, every agent starts with one vote and may have other votes assigned to them via delegation from other agents. They can choose to delegate all votes assigned to them to another agent or vote directly with all votes assigned to them. However, many proposed realizations of liquid democracy allow for agents to express their delegation/voting preferences in more complex ways (e.g., a ranked list of potential delegates) and employ a centralized delegation mechanism to compute the final vote tally. In doing so, centralized delegation mechanisms can make decisions that affect the outcome of a vote and where/whether agents are able to delegate their votes. Much of the analysis thus far has focused on the ability of these mechanisms to make a correct choice. We extend this analysis by introducing and formalizing other important properties of a centralized delegation mechanism in liquid democracy with respect to crucial features such as accountability, transparency, explainability, fairness, and user agency. In addition, we evaluate existing methods in terms of these properties, show how some prior work can be augmented to achieve desirable properties, prove impossibility results for achieving certain sets of properties simultaneously, and highlight directions for future work.","Fri, 10 Jun 2022 20:11:35 UTC (1,853 KB)"
