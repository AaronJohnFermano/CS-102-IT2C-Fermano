"1","Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery","Tweetienator","A Step Back","I liked the first Knives Out a lot because it felt like a warm homage to all those Agatha Christie novels that I like (books and movies): it got an interesting case and setting, a well playing cast, a fine production. Glass Onion is a little different - the story/crime is for
sure not that interesting or complex and there is a far stronger emphasis on comedy. One could dare to say that Glass Onion is more of a parody than a ""real"" crime case. The first movie got a straight 8, this one, did entertain me too (despite some lengthy parts) - but compared to the first movie, Glass Onion is for sure a big step in the wrong direction (for my taste) - it reminds me a lot of those mediocre attempts of Kenneth Brannagh's to revive Hercule Poirot. Also I do not like the ending at all, too a certain degree it is just a stupid one. Hopefully, the next one focuses again more on a complex crime case and its build up and last but not least, a real interesting and surprising ending like the first one got.

"2","Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery","Top_Dawg_Critic","Fun, but not as good as the first one.","The casting and performances by all were outstanding, especially Bautista and Norton, and I really liked the setting in Greece, but I feel the ending ruined what could've been a better sequel. There certainly was some creative ideas in the narrative, and even though the start was slow and tedious, it did get better when Benoit Blanc started to unravel the mystery. However, the unravelling was too as-a-matter-of-factly and too convenient in its set-up. And normally I'd be fine with that, because the few twists were a nice touch, but then right after the mystery was solved, the ridiculous antics just became too unbelievable and quite frankly, unnecessary. Still, and enjoyable one-time watch, especially if you enjoyed the first one.

"3","Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery","Leofwine_draca","Not one for mystery fans","As a mystery lover, this one disappointed me. The first movie, KNIVES OUT, was a reasonable reworking of the murder mystery genre but this one merely copies that and forget to be a mystery in its own right. It instead becomes an open satire of the mega rich and a certain Twitter-owning individual in particular, which is fine, but I couldn't help but feel this was missold. The first half is enjoyable, Craig's broad performance in particular a hoot, but then we start breaking all of the rules and overflowing with cliches. There's an excruciating fifty-minute flashback, a cheesy twin twist, and even the old saved-by-a-bullet-hitting-something-in-their-pocket moment, which I openly groaned at. As for the mindlessly destructive climax, is this the best they could come up with?

"4","Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery","eve_dolluk","It was written on a napkin","After the first Knives Out I was expecting better than this. As Benoit pointed out the whole thing is stupid. Ironic really, i mean was that what this was supposed to be ?? A big fat Ironic slap in the face.The acting was slapstick, over dramatic silliness. Not like the first film which was subtle black comedy. This was in your face amateur stage play style stuff.The plot tries to be clever and has a few reveals but none are particularly jarring nor interesting. The overall message seemed to be beware of Shills.Poor plot, poor acting, poor start and poor ending. There is a moment in the middle when you think there is hope for this yarn but it just fizzles out like a burn't napkin. Probably the same napkin the script was written on.When the credits roll your just left with a sinking feeling you were the one conned. No idea how its got a high rating, probably due to all the dreck thats been released this Christmas.5/10.

"5","Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery","levybob","What's Wrong With Me?","I feel as though there's something 'wrong' with me. So many people I know, and respect, DID truly enjoy 'Glass Onion'. But for me, this film was so over-the-top that I continually felt as though I were watching a TV sit-com or vaudeville show. That, not a film during which several central characters actually are murdered. And a murderer must be uncovered.By 'over-the-top' I mean this. (1) The acting was as broad as a slap-stick comedy. (2) The dialogue was not the least bit anchored in anything approaching reality. (3) The look of the film, the overdone brightness and color saturation of the production, made it almost an animated feature. And finally (4) there is the issue of Daniel Craig's dialect, which I have to say I found annoying. At best.A group of people are invited to a Greek Island on which a game will be played. But once there they learn that the game has already begun and that murder, or the prevention of it, is the game's objective. As with Agatha Christy mysteries, each invitee has a reason to murder someone, and with the group unable to depart the island, murder will no doubt take place. But - for the reasons outlined above - we (or 'I') did not care. On the positive side I enjoyed Kate Hudson as an aging beauty. As to the rest of the performances, the less said the better, but Edward Norton as the island's host stands out in terms of his being entirely miscast.I don't want to say more, for fear of giving too much away.So, that's it. If you're anything like my friends, you'll enjoy this piece of nonsense.But if you're anything like me, you'll cringe. And perhaps seek out some new friends.

"6","Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery","imseeg","NO vibe. NO soul. NO laughs. NO credibility. Guess what? It's ANOTHER Netflix flop","Pffff......Netflix these days has got a lot of financial, power, BUT that (unfortunately) does NOT equal CREATIVE power.What's wrong with this movie? It sure as heck is BORING. And so it goes...The bad: this movie has got NO soul. NO vibe. NO spark or punch. If your are cool with that, okay be my guest and watch it for yourself...Netflix is not all bad for the cinema experience, but unfortunately A LOT of so called Netflix ""movies"" are pictures based on database searches of what are the most common preferences that most people (probably) like to see . The result? A BLAND and PREDICTABLE story from start till finish.Is it all bad? Nope. The acting performances are okay. Edward Norton is always fun to watch. But even he cant save this movie from being BLAND.Sorry, I honestly tried to like it, but it bored me from the start till the very end...

"7","Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery","goodriddance_92","I'm glad to see I'm not the only one who was disappointed","What happened?!I am so bitterly confused!I was looking forward to this film so much after Knives Out instantly becoming one of my all time favourites.Did I overhype it? Were my expectations too high? Did I watch the same film as the critics?By all means, I'm not saying this is a bad film but compared to the original, it misses rather hard. What an absolute let down.I have no complaints about the cast, the score, the cinematography, the direction etc. It's the writing. Did Rian Johnson just forget what sort of film he was writing or something? It certainly showed a lot of promise in the first act, it definitely had me intruiged. The middle act had it's moments of twists and revelations I suppose. But the last act - what happened? What a mess. There was no pay off. It was such an unsatisfying conclusion. Honestly, it felt like they may as well have just said; ""It was all a dream"". It was so much off the mark which really hurts.I'm glad to see that I guess a lot of people enjoyed it and maybe the next installment will be better. One can only hope.

"8","Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery","mazbutt-16041","Slow start, exciting middle and childish end...","I really enjoyed Knives Out and was looking forward to the sequel with much anticipation ever since it was announced. I was, however, disappointed.With Glass Onion, director and writer Rian Johnson shows once again that he can carefully craft an intriguing story with brilliant direction. But with a bigger budget comes many challenges and unfortunately the movie fails when it is trying too be too extravagant and a spectacle for the viewers.The core story is very interesting and after a dull start, the middle of the film really hits it's stride with Johnson moving his playing pieces about with ease and wonderment. That was when i most enjoyed the movie.But the ending was ultimately disappointing. Childish humour and some sequences that were clearly for spectacle which i can only describe as 'throwing a tantrum' ruined this movie for me.I had some fun with this but was left feeling robbed as there was definitely a compelling enough story here for this to be another great movie. I do feel the more intimate character/story driven moments in this film are where it shines and not in the big budget set pieces.Watch this if you enjoy the genre, but please lower your expectations before doing so!

"9","Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery","saru2020","not as good as its previous one","The genre/plot is almost like the old one with a little bit of gameplay sprinkled on top of it.There were some aha moments & some thrilling ones as well but we just feel like keep comparing it to its previous one and maybe that's why it wasn't enjoyable to me personally to the level where the first one was.It is still notable that with the same kinda investigative plot, the movie still keeps you hooked till the very end, of course only if you like watching movies of this genre.And the best part of this installment is that you get to see a lot of different places, just more pleasing to the eyes when compared to its previous one, although the whole movie happens on just one single island.Overall, it's a good one-time if you haven't watched the first part.

"10","Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery","davidallenxyz","Entertaining but loses momentum","Watching on the big screen, at its best this would be a solid 8+/10 movie, but there are a few areas that let it down.First is the excessive lockdown/mask/Zoom scenes at the start of the film. This was never good comedic or dramatic material in the first place, and has already aged badly.Second is a somewhat over-the-top finale which aims for spectacular but ends up a bit silly - and that isn't where a murder-mystery should be. Less is more.But the greatest problem is the decision to re-tell the whole story from a different perspective half-way through. After carefully building the tension so that darkness falls with a murderer on the loose... the audience is taken back to the start again. It completely ruins the momentum of the film. Granted, this does allow the reveal to be even more complicated, but it also greatly reduces the wow-factor of Benoit Blanc's deduction. The genius detective solving the case is the fulcrum of this kind of movie and shouldn't be diminished.Production values are high, and the supporting cast are good, although some have fairly slender roles. Kate Hudson is superb as Birdie.In conclusion, I'm pleased to see Blanc back. Daniel Craig brought more eccentricity to the character this time around, but I liked it. A modern-day Poirot. I'd happily see a series of his adventures on the big screen. Just return to a more traditional murder-mystery structure (please).
