"9","Sponge","Scrub Daddy Flex Texture Cleaning Sponge, Original Yellow 4 1/8 inches","Graz","This is the best sponge ever made! It is so versatile and easy to use. The material makes it easy to clean! I’ve personally tested it on a new regular sponge and the scrub daddy got everything off the dish in 2 swipes (the sponge took 9 and there was still some left over). You can also use the mouth to clean spoons which is a little bit of a gimmick but it still works incredibly well. My favourite feature is cleaning cups with the scrub daddy. Just stick your fingers in the eyes and twist it in a cup. It’s as good as new! I love this sponge and i’m definitely buying more!","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Australia on 22 November 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars"

Scrub Daddy is the best sponge cleaner ever made, hard when cold and soft when hot, come on can't beat that kind of dedication and thought process put into designing and making Srub Daddy. Make sure to get one, I definitely recommend getting one to start out with them I believe they have a 10 or 8 box deal which is the best. Stocking up is good.

Tuning stability is good, but initially they might get detuned due to phosphor coating slippage.To check for ordinal daddario, always remember that there will a matt rubber type coating on the packet surface and inside packet, there will be a unique code which you can verify on official daddario site","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in India on 25 March 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars"

"253","Shorts","Hanes Men's Short Sleeve Beefy T (Pack of 2)","Mrs susan","Even unwrapping these t-shirts I knew they were going to be big. Upon donning them I was right, they are huge. In fact I bought another brand at the same time also in XXL and laying one on top of the other showed a significant difference in size. The Hanes Beefy shirts are at least 3XL using other makes as a guide. It's not a huge issue, I wear tees in winter for layering, but they're so big they look daggy at the neck, the only part that shows. Made in Haiti so it's gratifying to see manufacturing in poor countries adjacent to the US. They are thick as advertised, but in the absence of significant shrinkage I'd go a size down, hoping of course that the size difference is consistent across the Hanes Beefy range (i.e. one size too big). The image shown has Aquagard T-shirts in XXL on top of the Hanes in XXL and the difference is significant- and the yellow shirts were larger than other XXL tees I've purchased recently.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Australia on 11 January 2024","3.0 out of 5 stars"

    and they should be just fine for hot summer days.When you put it on out of the box it may feel just a bit on the 'rough' side but after an hour or so, you won't even notice it. When you touch the fabric it feels really soft.The color (I bought the so-called 'deep red' is a bit brighter than on product photo. I'm a guy who doesn't like bright colors but this one is just about as bright as I can accept it. In fact, it's a kind of unique red that I really like that will make you stand out from the crowd in a good way. And if you running or ride a bike, for sure you'll get noticed especially when crossing an intersection which is a good thing.As for shrinkage, just like with any 100% cotton t-shirt if you take proper care of it, like wash it in cold water, air dry it, you'll enjoy it for a long time.All in all a great product at a great price and I'm very happy with it!","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 21 December 2018","5.0 out of 5 stars"

I'm on the border between medium and large depending on the brand, I risked a medium and pleased to say this is a perfect fit, not tight, but also not too baggy. The material is very soft and thin, making it great for hot weather. I chose the dark olive which looks exactly like the photos. I'll definitely be ordering more of these!","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 5 July 2022","5.0 out of 5 stars"
"320","T-shirt","Lucky Brand","Samuel Mathews","I’ll start with the cons. After a few washes, the shirts pile up. (Tiny little cotton balls that pile up everywhere on the shirt) the colors do indeed fade, but who cares, it still looks good. I hardly ever gotten compliments on shirts but I did with these shirts but I didn’t get the shirts for that reason. They are very comfortable and have a great fit. Especially if you’re in the slightly athletic and up, build. Nice fit on the biceps. But not too tight, nice fit around the chest. It even accentuates your back quite well too. Look, they shirts are 20 bucks. Buy a couple colors you like, if you like them a lot, but one or two more of that same color and put them away for when they stop selling these shirts. They are worth the cons that everyone talks about.To make them last longer and keep their size. Never dry them using any heat, not even the delicate setting. I hang dry all of mine. I think air fluff dryer setting would work fine. Machine wash gentle. Even as they fade or “pile” up, they are still a much better looking shirt than any logo or solid color tee. Buy one! You’ll love it.True to size. Good length. I’m 6’4” 210, about a 40cm bicep. Sleeves are slightly snug on my arms for a nice look.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 27 December 2022","5.0 out of 5 stars"

"345","T-shirt","Lucky Brand","Rick Shaw","These shirts are a great alternative to men's T-shirts. They are stylish and come in many colors (I own about 12 different colors). The ONLY thing to know about them is that they wear out quickly (like 2 seasons). I wear mine a lot (7 months out of the year they are my main t-shirt), so they get washed a lot and quickly take on the faded (burn-out) look. It's a nice look up to a point, and then the shirts just look threadbare. But at $20-35 per shirt (depending on when I buy them) they are still a great deal if they last only 2 years. The fabrics vary from color to color, even though you'd think they are all made of the same stuff. For instance, the ""white"" color clearly has more cotton in the blend and will last longer. Some colors, seemingly randomly, last longer than others. But again, they ALL look great when new and I get compliments on them all the time. Several of my male friends have pretty much abandoned their old t-shirts in favor of a collection of the Venice Burn-out shirts. I sure I'll be buying more of them!","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 16 September 2023","3.0 out of 5 stars"

However, I do not prefer using them to heat food in the microwave as the lids tend to warp due to being made from plastic.On the other hand, I found them to be good for storing food in the freezer. Unfortunately, one of the lids broke due to the temperature change from cold to hot.

You only need to route your PSU cables which is very simple as the bad boy comes with cable wrappers.It comes with anti-dust mat which can hopefully prevent dust getting in, I dont know how it affects the airflow but it works well for my mid-high end pc with decent cpu/gpu temp.The rubbered legs are with good quality.

I also heard that the glass panels are difficult to obtain in Australia. Other than that this is a well designed case. I removed the 3.5in HDD bay at the bottom and this gave me heaps more space behind the PSU. The bay also moves a bit forward if do you have 3.5in drives to give a bit more space for cables at the back of the PSU. There are heaps of options for different sized fans and rads.

The case overall is nice and open, which means that you don't have to worry about populating the case with fans and optimising the fan pressure to get air through.The back of the case is spacious enough to accommodate bulky cables, and the removable cable guide is a great touch to help route and tie cables together.The downsides are that the grey feet and the front parts are plastic which feels a bit cheap, and that there's fairly limited I/O, e.g. ONLY ONE USB-A port in the front which takes up an entire USB3.0 header on the motherboard.

Turner","I love This little garden tool!  I keep composting worms to break down our table scraps and create worm castings for my houseplants and vegetable garden. Worms need a high moisture environment and a relatively neutral pH to thrive and produce a lot of castings so I this meter dozens of times each week.Over the years, I’ve purchased more expensive devices for pH monitoring as well as the cheap moisture meters that are all over Amazon. None of them has worked well. Either they have given bad readings or they're too cumbersome to use easily.When I saw this soil meter, with its unique design, and multi-functionality, I decided to give it a try. i had very low expectations because of my other experiences.I'm so glad I did. this meter is easy to use and highly responsive to different soil conditions. When I move from each worm bin, the moisture readings change, as you would expect. Sometimes a little and sometimes a lot. And I believe the accuracy is good too. Soil that seems dry gives a lower reading than soil that I know is more wet.I don't have as much to say about the pH meter. All my readings are between 6.5 and just over 7, as I would expect.  But the readings do change from sample to sample so I'm confident it's working.I don't use the light meter regularly but when I check my houseplants, I get readings that seem about right.  Same with the nutrients setting.If I had one critique, I'd say that the scale on the pH meter could be more centered around 7. It ranges from 1 to 8. Any readings below 5 or above 9 aren't too useful for gardening, but easily being able to see if the pH is 6.75 or 7.25 would be.Other than that I'm thrilled with this device, especially for the price. If I broke it tomorrow, I wouldn't hesitate to buy another.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 1 March 2023","4.0 out of 5 stars"

I bought this with my own money to try and give my own opinion.I bought this not expecting much, but I figured why not give it a try and see how it performs. Right out of the box it is surprisingly built well enough that I don’t feel like it’s going to break anytime soon although time will tell. It comes in a cheap box from China but it is packaged well to where it will not get banged around in shipping. When I first put this meter to the test I was surprised that the readings are pretty close to what the actual condition of the soil is. The light meter function works well in the sun. I was kind of bummed to see it will not work with my grow lights (it states this in the instructions but I tested anyway). The moisture feature is pretty accurate I first measured bone dry soil and it was accurate so I gradually added water and kept checking and the meter registered exactly what I was seeing. The nutrient function seems to be reading pretty accurate for what I believe to be in the soil but I’m skeptical of this I will have to do further testing on this function and compare with other meters and report back on this one. The PH function works as accurate as the other functions. I started with alkaline soil PH 7 and stuck the probe in and it registered it with no problem. I then started adding PH down (hydroponic ACID) to the water and added it to the soil. The meter registered the PH as acidic PH 3 which is accurate compared to digital PH meter and PH solution. Overall I’m impressed. This is a nice little meter for everyday gardening and to get an idea of how your soil and plants are doing. I wouldn’t use just this meter on prized plants and rely only on this meter but it is definitely worth having on hand.If this company has other products I would be willing to try the other products as well to see how they perform as well as recommend this product to friends.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 12 September 2022","5.0 out of 5 stars"

Some of my lawn is doing great, other areas not thriving. The measurements taken using this seems to match up to what I am seeing.Areas not thriving, ph is high and nutrient level low. Areas doing well have correct ph and decent nutrient reading.Helped me treat lawn as zones and hit with fertilizer a little heavier in some areas with lower nutrient levelYou will want to ensure that soil has some moisture to get accurate readings as it needs moisture to conduct signalI suspect this will save me money on lawn fertilizer over time. Once I get a baseline, I will know it's time to fertilize when I see reading dropThe ph reading seems fairly sensitive and although I don't have a control to compare it to. It seems to match up to what I am seeing in how well the grass is growing.From the directions, you should not pour or rinse with water. Wipe it with a towel and don't rinse it. I think if you leave in a pot, sensors will corrode and I will loose accuracy. Definitely don't want to water your plant while sensor is in pot.I was trying to figure out if it has battery or is solar powered or maybe powered by sensor electrodes.

Cons: probe is huge leaves a big hole in the soil. It takes a couple minutes to get a moisture reading. Not good for small pots unless you stand there and hold it. Otherwise, the top-heavy meter will tip the pot.  It doesn't appear to measure any amount of indirect/ambient sunlight. I've tried to measure the degree of indirect light in areas of a sunny room, trying to keep low light plants from burning. However, it only reacts to full sun near the window or in a beam of light, in which case it springs to the highest number. I found no way to measure degrees of light between full sun and darkness. Maybe its scientifically impossible with such a simple meter, but if thats the case, then its useless and they just shouldn't include it..

The moisture and fertility gauges are easy to view. The light sensor works just fine as well, but it's not really needed unless possibly for inside or under artificial light. It is pretty easy to see if the sun is shining on your plants. The instructions are ok but the print is pretty small. And watch for the little 2"" square piece of sandpaper to scratch the tip to get the PH meter to work.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 19 May 2023","4.2 out of 5 stars"

In other words, if you expose the sensor to sunlight the needle goes up, and if you cover the sensor with your thumb the needle goes down. Not sure who this is useful for. Is there a population of people who cannot identify sunlit areas with their eyes, but who can read the meter with their eyes?* Real electronic pH meters need frequent calibration, so I have zero hope for the pH function.* The soil moisture sensing seems to work the same as any probe. In my opinion this is the only really useful function.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 27 September 2023","4.0 out of 5 stars"

"551","Mouse","Razer Viper Ultimate Lightweight Wireless Gaming Mouse & RGB Charging Dock: Hyperspeed Wireless Technology - 20K DPI Optical Sensor - 78g - Optical Mouse Switch - 70 Hr Battery - Quartz Pink","gaolmao","For only around $40 AUD, this mouse is probably the best lightweight gaming mouse to ever exist.It's quite crazy how they've been able to cram so many features for such a low price point and here are some of them:- The mouse comes at 61g, making it one of the lightest mice out there for sale. If you play FPS games such as CSGO and Valorant, you'll definitely find that the tracking on this mouse is relatively easy.- The Razer Viper Mini uses PTFE skates. For people who don't know what that is, PTFE is basically the material that manufacturers use to create non-stick pans. It works great on a mouse pad too though.- For RGB lovers out there, the Razer Viper Mini, unlike its other Viper variants, has RGB underglow. It looks great when you're not using it but you probably won't be able to see it when your hand is covering it. It's funny though because the Razer Viper Mini has more RGB features while weighing less than other mice.- The actual design of the mouse itself is probably why it's so popular. The Viper Mini is definitely one of the most comfortable mice I've used. It fits great on your hand and the mouse buttons are positioned well to reduce thumb movement. The speed flex cable that Razer uses is also great as the mouse essentially feels wireless and weighs next to nothing.The only thing about the Razer Viper Mini that could potentially sway consumers away from it is its form factor. The only reason it's able to reach such a low weight is due to how small it is. People with large hands will find this mouse hard to use. The Viper Mini also doesn't come with grip tape like the Viper Ultimate or the Basilisk Ultimate, but its low cost of $40 AUD makes up for that.Overall I definitely recommend this product if you're in the need of a great budget mouse.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Australia on 25 May 2022","4.5 out of 5 stars"

A week after I got it I started butterfly clicking and even though this is a jitter clicking mouse, it is an amazing all-around gaming mouse and would buy again. EDIT: After a good 6 months or so later I still love this mouse and frequently use it but there are a few problems, Sometimes the click creaks and squeaks but it isn’t enough to bug me enough to buy another mouse. The other problem is the software. The software is pretty average. All it does is rob but there is some weird other software which tells me that I can’t change my RGB to what I personally want it to change to.

Buttons are industry standard. Cable is light, even with 80% hanging off the table. Razer Synapse is tolerable.The default lift off height felt noticeably high with a soft cloth mousepad (DM PAD L), so much that I've had to calibrate using the software to the Razer Vespula V2 Cloth and reduce 'Lift-Off Range' to 1.Now my main gripe with the mouse and what prompted me to write this review is the scroll wheel. Other reviewers mention issues with the scroll wheel click or a lack of free scroll, but worse yet I often find myself fiddling with a scroll wheel that triggers a stutter scroll in the opposite direction each swipe of the wheel either due to a lack of tactility or resistance or design of the scroll wheel... or a firmware(?) issue. This could be manufacturing deviance.This frustration builds up if you scroll a lot, and if you've found this review, I can imagine you might have scrolled quite a bit.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Australia on 25 May 2022","3.0 out of 5 stars"

"1158","T-shirt","Champion Mens GT22H Graphic Jersey Muscle Sleeveless Shirt","Richie","I love sleeveless shirts because it's comfortable like a t-shirt, and loose fitting like a tank top.I'm a tall guy (6'5"") and I bought the large size. Here is my feedback after wearing and washing it twice:Pros:- Fast delivery- White shirt looks fantastic- Length is great for my long torso- I washed in warm and hung dry with no change in shape or color.- Makes my arms look good! HahaCons:- Fabric could be a bit softer- It's a touch too baggy for me, but then again, I have gotten used to it and it still looks really good on me being tall and slim.- It's a bit expensive.Final Thoughts:I am happy with this purchase and ended up buying the dark blue one too. I really like these shirts and I feel they are worth the money even though you are paying for the brand name. I do recommend this shirt, especially if you have a longer torso like me.Hope this helps!! Thanks.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Canada on 14 July 2021","5.0 out of 5 stars"

"1166","T-shirt","Champion Mens GT22H Graphic Jersey Muscle Sleeveless Shirt","Bruce John","This is actually a good product, the material isn’t that thick cotton feel that champion uses as a signature material on most of there regular sleeved shirts. This is a regular standers thin cotton. Important to know that the shoulders extend outward. Further than most sleeveless tanks. I think this is just a style for this design. Some tanks don’t have an extended shoulder. This one does. The size is a bit bigger. Don’t expect a perfect fit. I wouldn’t say order a size down but expect it to feel loose and a bit baggy. This is not fitted, so all you body builders who want that snugged feel or to accent your small waist and emphasize your shoulders this isn’t the fit. It’s a bit more boxy. The solid logo on the back of the shirt gives it a very expansive casual feel. So this is gym appropriate but also going for a walk down the pier and grabbing an outdoor lunch appropriate too. This look will def compliment a chain and bracelet  accessories without you looking too try hard. Over all def worth the price point! Finally another amazon hit. Go for it!

"1275","Shorts","Real Essentials 5 Pack: Men's Dry-Fit Sweat Resistant Active Athletic Performance Shorts","Clinton Wiebe","I have two sets of these shorts, one I purchased in august of 2020 and one in august 2021. Clearly I went back to buy another set a year later so I must like them, and I do. They are priced INCREDIBLY well. At the time of the first purchase, I had just started playing sports again and needed lightweight shorts to cut and move in. These are DEFINITELY those shorts. They breath very well, they're comfortable enough that now I not only work out in them, I lounge around the house in them and go to sleep in them as well. They've held up pretty well to washing. I wash them on hot with powdered detergent and oxiclean powder and rinse them twice and then dry them on medium heat. They've probably gone through at least 100 washes thus far and I'm still wearing them. Yes, some of the seams have loose thread, yes some of them start to come off over time but they're $6 a short and none of them have unraveled to the point that there are any holes or they are unwearable, it's just something you would see when you look at the inner part of the waistband.The ONE weakness of these shorts is the pockets. I've had several that have started developing holes in the side seams of the pockets. Now it only started happening a year+ later and they've been beat up and washed many times so that's not quite so bad, but still it'll happen. I suspect this is more to do with how big and heavy phones are nowadays since it's always on my right pocket (where my phone goes) and started pretty much after I upgraded from an iphone 7 to an iphone 13 pro. But two years and 100+ aggressive washings later, only 3 out of 10 shorts have pocket holes and only one has a hole big enough that I'm scared to put my phone in the pocket.These are fantastic shorts and they could easily charge double. I plan to replace some of the original ones with a new set even now.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 9 September 2022","1.0 out of 5 stars"

Was immensely disappointed in those 2 cheaper shorts (they were stained and seemed to be in a warehouse for some time as the elastic in the waistband was audible when stretched as if already dry-rotting).The correct shorts were great, they were much thinner than I expected, but very breathable and elastic. Decided to give it another shot and purchased the same item once more and actually got 5 correct branded shorts this time, same quality that I was hoping for. This time there was even a thank you card in the packaging and the packaging was different to my first order.

First I must say, as a guy I am used to the demin or thick cotton feel for pants/shorts, these are not that feel. These are a stretchy material. When wearing them they are very comfortable and when you sit, as a guy the material is stretchy so you can sit down comfortably without issues. They look like regular shorts, I feel the waistband is a little wider but not in a bad way. I have washed this pair 3x now, they wash well, no fading or coming apart as I read in one review but they do look wrinkly, not bad enough to have to iron them, besides when you put them on the wrinkles seem to go away, I think its the stretchy material that makes them look that way. I paid $27 for this paid off shorts and it's about as hight as I would want to pay. I do need to mention that I did order a second pair, black as these are more of an olive color.

These shorts fit great, and the material (mostly nylon) is lightweight and flexible. They come with two zipper pockets that are perfect for traveling or day-to-day. They are cut a bit narrow in the leg, which is fine for me (5'10"", 170lb.) I bought granite (dark gray) and sagebrush (grayish green). I tried the bronze but didn't like the color.

A lot of the reviews say true to size so I ordered the 38"".  If I lost a pound and jumped up and down they would have fallen to my ankles.  I guess if you like wearing a belt and like that really loose feel then stick to the 38"".  I'm big shoulders no butt so I need that little bit of extra tension to keep my drawers up. I reordered the 36"" and they fit great. Puts the ""Flex"" to a little but of test but that's what it's there for and it's comfortable. Also the smaller size looks better because the legs aren't so large. There was a huger difference between the 38"" and 36"".Performance: I usually graduate my clothes to ""yard gear"" after they have had a year or so of normal wear. I immediately put these to the test doing yard work and I will wear these from now on.  They were light which kept me cool, the waist was flexible but comfortably snug and the front pockets were deep enough to hold my phone with no issues. I push-mow a large yard and bag the clippings. My neighbors will appreciate that now when I bend over to remove the bagger they won't be confused that a plumber is doing my yardwork. Highly recommend these and also recommend the Flex version of the Wrangler jeans that are sized in a similar fashion.  I have bought another pair and will likely buy a few more. I would even work out at the gym in these when that time comes... maybe having these will motivate me to get there.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 7 April 2021","5.0 out of 5 stars"

The absolutely most important feature of these shorts that is not evident on the Amazon web site is that they truly have STRETCH. I an a waist 33 and I ordered a 32. They fit perfectly since the waist and the pants have great stretch. They would also fit perfectly for someone with a 32 inch waist. Too many pants on the internet are described as having a stretch feature, but in fact do not. Secondly, there is not description of the pockets. These shorts have 7 pockets, but you would not know it from the website. Zippers are on the two side cargo pockets so you can secure your phone and wallet in these pockets if you will be exercising. The other pockets are deep, as is the ""watch"" pocket. Great fabric. I reordered another pair after wearing the first pair.

"1339","Shorts","Wrangler Mens Performance Comfort Flex Waist Cargo Short Cargo Shorts","JC","I recently bought a pair of Wrangler ""Outdoor Series"" cargo shorts on clearance at a local Target store, model NT980GT. I really like the fit and the fabric and the zipper side pockets. Come to find out they were discontinued, but my searches kept bringing me back to these Wrangler ""Authentics"" cargo shorts, model ZM980GT. After carefully looking at the pictures and comparing them to my Outdoor Series pair, the pockets, the stitching, etc, appeared to be exactly the same. So I bought a pair in the hopes they were.While almost identical, this newer Authentics version is a little different than those discontinued Outdoor Series pair. First, they're about an inch longer. Not a huge difference, but I'm 6'2"" and I prefer where the Outdoor Series shorts sit above my knee. The second thing I noticed is they're slightly slimmer in fit, just a little less room around. And the waistband seems less stretchy. They clearly went cheap on the new zippers. Most people won't notice or care, but after having the better, lock-down zipper heads on the Outdoor Series, these cheap floppy zipper heads are just annoying to me. And while both shorts are listed as Granite (GT), these are lighter in color.Honestly though, for all my moaning about these slight differences, if I didn't already have the older version I wouldn't know and would be perfectly happy with these shorts. They are still just as comfortable, made with the same nylon/spandex mix, and seem just as well stitched together. Knowing the differences, my only real gripe is the zippers. Still very comfortable and well fitting shorts.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 8 March 2018","4.0 out of 5 stars"

I wanted them to be tight fitting so I ordered L thinking it should work, but they are wayyyyy too big. I should have just gone with my normal sizing instead of following their guide. So now I'm stuck with them since they came from Amazon US to Amazon AU, paying an extra $20 for quick shipping, and for me to return them it will cost me another $24 in shipping!

En effet, un lavage rapide est suffisant et la matière utilisée est impossible à tacher.🟢 Les finitions sont très bonnes ; aucun fil ne dépasse.❌ Les moins :🔴 Bien que la corde permette un réglage facile, il est important de noter que celle-ci peut quitter son logement en cas de lavage en machine, si aucun nœud n’est réalisé au préalable.

"1477","Shorts","Nike","TK","Ich wollte euch gerne von meinen Erfahrungen mit den Nike Herren Fußballshorts berichten, die ich mir vor einiger Zeit gekauft habe. Ich muss sagen, ich bin absolut begeistert! Obwohl sie eigentlich für den Fußball gedacht sind, habe ich sie hauptsächlich für mein Training im Fitnessstudio verwendet.Was mir sofort aufgefallen ist, ist wie unglaublich bequem die Shorts sind. Das Material ist angenehm weich und elastisch, was eine optimale Bewegungsfreiheit ermöglicht. Egal ob ich Gewichte hebe, Cardio mache oder mich beim Boxen austobe, ich fühle mich in den Shorts jederzeit wohl und uneingeschränkt.Ein weiterer großer Pluspunkt ist die Atmungsaktivität der Shorts. Das Material ermöglicht eine gute Luftzirkulation und verhindert, dass ich übermäßig schwitze. Das ist besonders wichtig, wenn ich mich richtig ins Training reinhänge und ordentlich ins Schwitzen komme. Die Shorts halten mich angenehm kühl und trocken, sodass ich mich voll und ganz auf mein Workout konzentrieren kann.Die Passform der Shorts ist ebenfalls super. Der elastische Bund und der verstellbare Kordelzug sorgen dafür, dass die Shorts perfekt sitzen und nicht verrutschen. Das ist gerade bei Übungen wie Kniebeugen oder Burpees wichtig, bei denen man viel hin und her bewegt. Die Shorts bleiben an Ort und Stelle, ohne mich in meiner Bewegungsfreiheit einzuschränken.Ich hoffe, meine persönliche Erfahrung mit den Nike Herren Fußballshorts hilft euch bei eurer Entscheidung. Wenn ihr noch weitere Fragen habt, stehe ich gerne zur Verfügung!","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Germany on 26 June 2023","4.0 out of 5 stars"

Diese Shorts sind schlicht, bequem und erfüllen ihren Zweck hervorragend.Die Passform der Shorts ist großartig. Sie sitzen gut und bieten ausreichend Bewegungsfreiheit für verschiedene Aktivitäten. Der Stoff ist leicht und atmungsaktiv, was ein angenehmes Tragegefühl ermöglicht. Egal, ob ich mich im Fitnessstudio auspowere oder einfach nur zu Hause entspanne, diese Shorts fühlen sich immer gut an.Das Design der Nike Fußballshorts Park II ist schlicht und dennoch ansprechend. Das Nike-Logo verleiht ihnen einen Hauch von Sportlichkeit und Qualität. Sie sind in verschiedenen Farben erhältlich, um unterschiedlichen Geschmäckern gerecht zu werden.Ein Aspekt, den ich erwähnen möchte, ist jedoch das Fehlen von Taschen. Das kann enttäuschend sein, besonders wenn man gewohnt ist, Kleinigkeiten wie Schlüssel oder ein Handy in den Taschen zu verstauen. Es ist jedoch wichtig zu beachten, dass diese Shorts primär für sportliche Aktivitäten gedacht sind, bei denen das Tragen von zusätzlichen Gegenständen oft hinderlich sein kann.Trotzdem kann ich sagen, dass die Nike Herren Fußballshorts Park II eine gute Wahl sind, wenn ihr leichte und bequeme Shorts für verschiedene Anlässe sucht. Sie sind vielseitig einsetzbar und erfüllen ihren Zweck gut.Aufgrund des Fehlens von Taschen gebe ich diesen Shorts 4 von 5 Sternen. Sie bieten Tragekomfort und ein ansprechendes Design, aber eine kleine Tasche würde sie noch praktischer machen.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Germany on 11 June 2023","4.0 out of 5 stars"

They’re comfortable, light weight and don’t look bad either. Good for wearing around the house, running to the store, work, and anywhere else you’re comfortable wearing athletic shorts.The only negative that is a possibility is they will wear out faster than my Nike shorts, but I’m just assuming. Even if they do wear out faster I can still buy at least three pairs of these for the price of one pair of Nike shorts.Also I got fooled by the image. I thought one pair I ordered was white, but turned out to be grey. I made the mistake of not reading the item description, it does indeed say grey. Thought the order picker made a mistake, but it was my mistake.They seem to run a little bigger compared to the same size Nike shorts. I bought a XL assuming they’d be the same size, I think I could have ordered a large and they would fit perfect. Should have ordered according to their sizing chart.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 15 March 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars"

"1584","Shorts","Under Armour Men's Armour HeatGear Compression Shorts","Cesar Carranco","First off, these are top notch, have great colors, and feel durable. I put a pool in my backyard and decided it was time to update my 15 year old Walmart swim trunks so I visited a few websites and decided I’d form brand loyalty with “Salt Life”. I knew I wanted the board shorts and didn’t need another set of trunks with a net inside (I decided on Columbia shorts with the net). I prefer board shorts and they are so much more comfortable however I don’t care for the lack of support and probability I’d be the guy from “Friends” in the coffee shop that Phoebe was dating. Boxers underneath are an option but they take forever to dry and will inevitably cause an apocalyptic rash. So, I set out to find an alternative and decided on these. Low and behold they work perfectly and I now have a pair of these for every set of board shorts. These do increase the time it takes to dry unfortunately, but they won’t wage war on everything sensitive and they dry faster than boxers.Update 9/17/2023: Just ordered and received a third pair of these. They are sure pricey but I love them still. Each pair is holding up great and still fit well.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 21 April 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars"

"1617","Shorts","Wrangler","RiiDeemed","I've always had Wrangler products in the past (mostly jeans) but I've come across a few of their cargo shorts.  I wasn't sure what to expect with this pair of pants as I've had bad experiences in the past with older companies going ""cheap"" and sacrificing quality for the sake of better margins (i.e. Levi's).This pair of pants definitely exceeded my expectations in terms of quality, comfort and style!  It fit very snug and the premium twill is worth the extra $ and the pricing is still competitive enough to consider this a bargain.  I was expecting a bit more ""padding"" in terms of the material used as it is a bit thinner compared to previous pants I've worn from Wrangler.  It doesn't seem like it will wear out quickly so maybe the thinner material was done on purpose to help with comfort in the heat.  I've owned these for about 3 years now and they are still going strong!  Finally made the time to review these.

I suppose you could lay the phone in sideways in one of the three larger pockets but I don't see that as convenient.  I like the shorts and they fit just right.  The length is just at or slightly below my knees which is what I had been looking for (short shorts seem to be what's mostly offered in stores lately and I'm not a fan) and these are perfect for me.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 5 June 2022","5.0 out of 5 stars"

"1712","Shorts","Canterbury Advantage Short","Rugby","Edit 29th Apr 18. Worn about 20 times since purchase and now ripped at stitching at rear seam whilst squatting. This is not at the stretch panel, shame they didnt use a bit of the stretch panel at the rear seam.Over all still good shorts but just cant handle heavy squatting. I am tempted to try a larger size see if the extra room will perform better.Very strong shorts with stretch material in backside area which is good for squatting, as they don’t rip like most do under heavy load. They have a good rise as well which is rare in today’s climate of shorts hanging half way down your backside. However they are totally let down when it comes to leg room. I purchased a size up from what I needed as recommended in another review and they are barley loose on my thighs. After squatting in them I have been left with red marks and bruising where the material has been so tight around my thighs. I thought rugby shorts would be good due to the leg size of the players, clearly not in this case. If you have larger thighs (mine are only 29 inches, so I don’t consider them large at all) and plan on doing gym work I would avoid these. Such a shame as could have been perfect with 1-2 more inch of thigh room.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Australia on 1 April 2021","5.0 out of 5 stars"

Having quite big thighs and butt, I struggle with most training pants, particularly at the bottom of the squat. I have ripped several trousers this way and the result with some shorts is that they stick on the thighs and pull the waistband down, so I end up partially mooning the rest of the gym while in the squat rack!The added thick lycra/ stretch areas around the groin and sides of the thighs mean these babies stay right where you put the on and no risk of exploding out of them. Tough and durable as well and the material doesn't fade when washed.

The length is perfect, not too long and not too short, just above the knees.  The crotch area is very comfortable, when you sit your friends will not get crushed.  Pockets are nice and deep, I can fit my iPhone 13 Max comfortably and without having to constantly adjust and it doesn't leave a big imprint, even when i sit down the phone is not in the way.  I am 5'9"" and 180 Lbs athletic build and waist 35 fits me very well.  The cloth and workmanship is also good.  My plan is to eventually buy all the colors.  So the fit, the style, the cloth, the tailoring all combine to give you a relaxed summery shorts.  if you are looking for skinny fit tight shorts then don't get these.

I was looking at the burnt sienna for a while but I was worried that they were going to be too orange and/or too bright. They aren't. The product photo is pretty close to what you get. In bright light like in the photo of me wearing them, they do appear lighter but it's not obnoxious.I would refer to these more as burgundy than orange but color perception can be variable across people.I am not the kind of person who wears bright colored shorts that stand out. My other shorts are tan, light grey, dark gray, khaki... These burnt sienna shorts are on the edge of my comfort zone but I really like them!As for the shorts themselves, I love them. I already have several other pairs of Volcom shorts. They are casual but look polished. The length falls at my knee (I'm 6 feet tall). They have a slightly slim cut so they aren't baggy. Deep front pockets.

They aren’t baggy but they are loose enough that you don’t feel like you will hulk your way through the fabric. The waste has a slight stretch that gives you a perfect half size to full size of play which is perfect for me, a 40 year old man with three kids, who does not watch what he eats. Put these in your cart and wait until the price goes down because these and Levi’s jeans always go on sale at some point where you can spend almost half as much and sometimes less. I got them in black and they will match everything. I am 5’11” and 180lbs and a 33” waste is good for me. Lots of useable pockets and the front ones are nice and deep perfect for your cell phone and wallet. Even enough room for a phone and pocket knife in the same pocket.

"1934","Shorts","Lee Mens 21861 Extreme Motion Swope Cargo Short Cargo Shorts","Jessica Jeppesen","The comfort level of these shorts is outstanding. The fabric has just the right amount of stretch, allowing for unrestricted movement during any physical activity. Whether I'm hiking, cycling, or simply lounging around, the shorts never feel restrictive or uncomfortable. The waistband is adjustable and features a flex waist for a customizable fit, adding to the overall comfort factor.In terms of durability, the Lee Men's Extreme Motion Swope Cargo Shorts certainly impressed me. I have worn them on multiple occasions, and they have held up remarkably well. The construction feels solid, and the stitching is strong, ensuring that these shorts will withstand the test of time. Even after frequent use and washing, I have not noticed any signs of wear or tear.The cargo pockets are another notable feature of these shorts. They provide ample storage space for essentials like keys, a phone, or a small wallet. The pockets are deep enough to securely hold items, and the Velcro closures ensure that nothing falls out during physical activities or when you're on the move.The only reason I deducted one star from the rating is that, while the shorts are durable overall, the color tends to fade slightly after repeated washes. However, this is a minor drawback and doesn't significantly impact the functionality or overall appeal of the shorts.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 14 February 2018","5.0 out of 5 stars"

I liked the features of the UnionBay brand, so I ordered them in a size 32, they fit perfect! Although, I was surprised that they seamed to be made of o heavier cloth material and the small pocket, on each leg, did not have a flap over the pocket. I used the small pocket for small items, like nail clippers, small Leatherman, etc.. The very first day I wore one of the pairs, I lost my favorite nail clippers. A real bummer. Lesson learned: Don't put anything anything in the small pockets because you have a very good chance of loosing whatever you put in them.

Fabric is decent thickness and soft. Minimal number of belt loops. I like the color (Android), it looks like the pic. 1 point off for the zipper, which the up/down movement is not smooth, concern the this may limit the life of the shorts. Also the belt is a waste of material. Should can the belt and put that savings into a better, smoother operating zipper, then I'd give these shorts a 5!

Buttons make the flaps wrinkle when not buttoned up. Well stitched, The front pockets are deep, so things won't fall out, well worth the money to me. Con's would be that they are 11 inch inseam, and is over the top part of my knee cap. I prefer a 9 inch inseam. Last time I bought cargo shorts was 15 years ago, and the material is thinner then my old ones. The small front pocket on the left side, made for a key fob doesn't have a Velcro flap, and you could possibly lose your key fob if it were to fall out. The belt looks ok, but I use my own belt.

"2040","Shorts","Liberty Imports Pack of 5 Men's Athletic Basketball Shorts Mesh Quick Dry Activewear with Pockets","Freda","These aren’t high quality athletic shorts by any means, they’re 1 layer of fabric that isn’t the softest or most breathable. But they’re still very comfortable and an exceptional value. We got these mostly for “days off” and relaxing at home and not to be too worried if the cats snag the fabric on them. A little disappointed with the print patterns on these shorts, I worry that it’ll crack or seriously degrade with frequent wear and washing. I’m 5’5, we got the large size and they’re a bit long on me, just below the knee so I tend to wear mine up a bit higher. My husband is 5’9 and the large fits him well and falls just above the knee. There is an adjustment band inside these in case you prefer to size up.

With that said, I'm pleasantly surprised! I've tried a number of cheaper brand shorts from Amazon over the years, and these are the perfect balance of fit, price, and weight without being see through. Are they the quality of a pair of $50 shorts from Nike? Well, no, but you're getting 5 pair for less than one of those, and I'd say the quality is 85-90% of the way there.The main problem I tend to have with cheap shorts is the fit. More often than not, they end up being too tight in the groin area, which makes them sit awkwardly on your thighs/butt. Not these though, they hang just right, and look just how they should. Going to order another set just because of how pleased I am!If you're looking for quality cheap shorts, these are for you!","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 26 February 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars"

After years of buying Champion brand, I decided to give the Russell product a try based on positive reviews. I found these to be a good value. What I like most about them is the fit, which is a bit looser and longer than the Champion model.  At 5'8"", 165 lbs with a 33 waist, medium is just perfect for me. The material is smooth and breathes well. The waist is snug enough for the shorts to stay put, but not too tight to be comfortable. I like the pockets, which I use to hold my little iPod shuffle during my workouts.

"2062","Shorts","Russell Athletic Men's Mesh Short with Pockets","D.D.","(I did not receive any compensation, discount or free products for my review. I don't work for this company. This is just flat honesty.)  The first thing I can say is I am pleasantly surprised that shorts of this quality come at such a low price point. That is a big selling point here. I could buy Nike, but why when I can get the same thing for $11-$12 bucks? That seems like a waste of money. Mind you, I'm not a, ""Keep up with the Jones' kind of guy.)  So, unless you just have to have a ""brand,"" buy 3 or 4 pair of these instead.  **After having having several pair of these shorts for over a month I came back to edit my review from a 4 star rating to a 5. I suppose since I've already ordered several additional pair I really like them. I wear them around the house every day. They are extremely comfortable - not only for relaxing but for yard work, painting, etc. In fact, I like these shorts so much that I hate it when I don't have a pair clean, so like I said, ""I ordered more!""  I live in central hell, where the summer climate is so hot that the last thing you want to do is work outside or in a hot garage. Yet, the mesh fabric accomplishes its job -matching the description. The mesh allows heat to escape and maintain a cool feeling without trapping in sweat. (Whomever created the fabric should be rich by now.) When beckoned I come in from the garage, sit down at the dinner table and the shorts are throughly dry.  *The shorts launder easily and hold up well in hot water and a hot dryer. No special steps required. I don't like athletic shorts that you can't just toss in the dryer. Some expensive shorts state, ""Wash only. Hang to dry."" That's too much work! Draw string is one piece with a knot below, so you don't have to worry about loosing the string in the washer and then trying to find it and put it back in. (I hate that.)  Exercising: I've worked out for 35 years, and I can tell you these are some of the coolest and most comfortable shorts I've ever worn. The pockets are the perfect depth. There is plenty of room to fit my keys and iphone 6-plus. Unlike some shorts, whatever is in my pocket's stays there. It does not fall out. (The manufacturer gets some points there.) I don't have to worry about loosing my keys, an adventure I'd rather skip. (Of course, be logical.) I wouldn't recommend engaging in heavy athletic activities with expensive items in your pocket, yet I can wear the shorts to make a quick trip to the store without my phone falling out.  Importantly, there is plenty of room in the circumference of the legs to allow for men with very muscular thighs. The fabric stretches a bit, but will not remain stretched out. If you have huge thighs you might consider ordering a size larger than normal unless you fancy very tight shorts? I've never had that issue. There is ample room in the crotch for any man; however, be aware that you will not get any athletic support from the shorts. So, depending you your preference and need you may wish to wear protection underneath.  Lastly, the shorts are a bit longer than I expected. The waist to knee measures 19"" and the crotch to bottom of shorts is 13"". I am 6'3"", and the bottom meets the top of my knee.  That is a thorough review of the shorts. I hope it helps you make an educated decision.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 12 May 2016","5.0 out of 5 stars"

I ordered a size L and they sent me an M.  The paper tag said L but the actual tag on the shorts said M so the mix-up was understandable.  I ordered a size L a second time so they would arrive on time for my boyfriend's birthday and emailed amazon about returning the size M.  I heard back right away from the seller and was told that my money will be refunded and that I do not have to go through the hassle of returning the shorts.The new shorts that were correctly labeled size L on both tags came in today and they are great.  The Texas Orange is a beautiful burnt copper color and I couldn't be happier about it.  The shorts themselves are long which is great because my boyfriend is 6ft 4 and has trouble with basketball shorts being too short sometimes, but these will look great on him.  The pockets are a big plus because he likes to have a place to put his keys and phone when he goes out.  The elastic on the shorts is really strong but very stretchy meaning that they will be comfortable but won't fall down.  What I loved the most about the shorts is how thin the material is.  My boyfriend gets very sweaty and always complains about shorts being 'too hot' but these are so airy and light that I think he will love them.  I will be ordering in more colors after I get his take on these shorts.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 27 September 2014","4.0 out of 5 stars"

"2082","Shorts","Russell Athletic Men's Mesh Short with Pockets","Haron Deinla","These shorts were definitely worth the buy. A lot better than I had expected, and here's why:-the shorts a very comfy. That may be due to the mesh being a little bit bigger in perforations as compared to other mesh shorts. The perforations are big enough to provide more than enough breathing room and ventilation, but not so big that the shorts are super-see through.-the material not only feels good but looks good. I ordered the green colorway and it looks really nice. I'm even planning on making another order, that is if I decide whether or not these are better quality than Champion branded shorts.-it has pockets which is a must for me when it comes to shorts I plan to use on a consistent basis to be able to hold my keys and wallet.-the drawstring is also strong enough so that if I were to have my phone, keys and wallet in my pockets, the shorts won't drop.All in all, these shorts are really nice, both for home use and outdoor use for walking and sports alike.If I were able to help you make a purchase, or help you prevent from making one you'd regret. Then all I ask is you thumbs up my review saying it was helpful, because knowing I helped someone out means a lot.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Canada on 10 August 2016","5.0 out of 5 stars"

"2092","Shorts","Russell Athletic Men's Mesh Short with Pockets","Scott Ivlow","I like Russel Athletic shorts for the brand it well worth the price. Rice hole mesh with pockets can be a hard find. Walmart's private label Athletic Works brand is so is Champion. However Russel Athletic is my second primary Sports Apperal Brand. Like having R. However they put it on everything they make. On this Black Mesh short you should get the Color R logo and not a White R. Dri Power isn't marked but it's a polyester material which makes it water resistant. I wear medium size shorts but with Russsel Athletics the waistbands have so much stretch and I don't need exessive baggy leg holes I always buy a size small and still get the same perfect fit as a medium and a 7"" inseam which is still perfect with my 6'2"" height. I hate long baggy basketball shorts. With Russel Athleticsit's baggy but not overly baggy in a small. I have multiple colors on these mesh shorts and continue to add more.

"2275","Shorts","Russell Athletic Men's Cotton Baseline Short with Pockets","Mrs Kelly Long","These shorts are great for lounging around the house, and for wearing to bed, especially if you don't like sleeping in long sweats/pajamas.I don't recommend these for the gym or really any outdoor activity due to the style and thin-fabric: They're really just too casual of a style for more than lounging. That's just my opinion, of course, so if you're the type of dude to wear old, ratty, grey sweats, or worn-out t-shirts with the sleeves personally cut-off, out in public -by all means, knock yourself out!I've had several pairs of these over the last decade, and they're my go-to sleep-shorts. All of my original purchases were at Sports Authority, then 2 from Amazon within the last year.Although they are pretty lightweight and soft, the shorts are comparatively quite durable, as none of mine have ever worn through or come apart -- I just seem to lose a pair every couple of years, on a trip or at a hotel stay, then re-purchase.  The current shorts' material is approximately the same as my originals, but the stitching around the waistband is much less detailed, and frankly looks a bit sloppy.  The older shorts had very detailed, sturdy, and useful stitching around the waist and drawstring-area -I've attached some pics for comparison.  My recent purchase had long strands of excess thread dangling from some of the stitching.  I had to trim all of this off, in lieu of better quality control at the factory or by the distributor.The inner tag is still annoyingly sewn into the vertical seam right at the top of your tailbone (butt-crack, to be crass), so I just carefully cut it out before the first laundering.I'm not a fan of logos -- but for information's sake, the logo used to be embroidered onto the leg and now it's simply silkscreened-on.The fit is ""as-expected"".I'm not super-happy with the waistband change or the loose thread everywhere, but I got my recent pair for half-off during prime-day, so -Score!","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 18 September 2023","4.0 out of 5 stars"

"2370","Shorts","CARHARTT Men's Force Relaxed Fit Ripstop Cargo Work Short","Consume!!!","These are VERY similar to ripstop BDU shorts made by Propper, Rothco or Tru-Spec but cost twice as much. There is no flexibility or adjustability in the waistband and they aren't as reinforced as the mil-spec cargo shorts. One trip through the washer and dryer and they fit like grape smugglers, so order a size up. Wash on cold, because they fade.The deal breaker for me, is that I go commando in the summer. The actual BDU shorts are button-fly, whereas these have a brutal tackle-snagging zipper.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 24 March 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars"

Man kann auch wunderbar einen Film nebenbei gucken oder im Internet surfen. Das Laptop ist sehr kompakt und definitiv handlich. Das Gehäuse ist ausreichend fest und für den mobilen Einsatz wirklich nicht schlecht. Der Prozessor und der Speicher sind etwas schwach dimensioniert - das weiß man aber vorher. Echte Leistungswunder darf man nicht erwarten - auch die Bildschirmauflösung ist nicht so wahnsinnig hoch. Die normalen Windows-Anwendungen laufen aber hinreichend gut. Der Sound ist super - das Mikrofon ist auch vernünftig - so wie man das bei HP eigentlich immer erwarten kann.Für einen festen Arbeitsplatz wäre es für uns nicht geeignet - für den mobilen Einsatz (Schultasche, zwischen den Autositzen eingeklemmt, für den Urlaub im Hotel ohne Safe, ...) ist es als zusätzliches Gerät anständig und bezahlbar. Im Falle eines Verlustes ist der Schaden begrenzt, falls die Schultasche doch einmal eine unvorhergesehene Flugbewegung vollzieht. Ein Sim-Slot wäre noch praktischer. Gut wäre es auch, wenn sich das Gerät über den USB-Port laden ließe - ein Drama ist es aber nicht - der Akku hält auch ein ganzes Weilchen. Die Ladestecker anderer HP-Netzteile passen - das ist sehr angenehm.Für den richtigen Zweck ist es ein echt brauchbares und bezahlbares Gerät.

Nach dem Auspacken das große Aha.... Die Verarbeitung ist absolut prima. Der Laptop scheint sehr stabil und die Tastatur ist einwandfrei und keineswegs labberig. Das Einrichten ging dann quasi wie von alleine und ist selbsterklärend. Anschließend wurden die Windows Updates heruntergeladen und installiert. Office 365 war auch als Gimmick mit an Bord, Herz, was willst du noch mehr? Der Bildschirm ist mit einer klaren Anzeige als einwandfrei zu bewerten. Der Rechner ist ausreichend schnell für Office-Anwendungen und zum Surfen im Internet, Streaming funktioniert ebenso einwandfrei. Die Akkuleistung geht auch absolut in Ordnung.Fazit: Ein kleiner schicker Reisebegleiter, der mehr Qualitäten hat, als der Preis vermuten ließe...

Wenn ich schon ins Netzwerk gezwungen werden soll und einen Online Account erstellen soll reicht es mir schon. Ich lasse mich von M$ nicht gängeln und der S Modus ist eh indiskutabel. Office 365 will ich auch nicht: Meine Office Dokumente gehen nur mich etwas an.Mit Linux Mint 21.2 Mate Edition (Kernel 5.15) läuft alles out of the Box und sehr zügig.Das Bios ist etwas ungewöhnlich aufzurufen: Nach Einschalttaste sofort ESC drücken, dann erscheint ein Auswahlmenue. F10 führt dann weiter ins Bios. Die Fxx Tasten direkt drücken (ohne Fn oder ALT etc.) Die Tastaturbeschriftung ist da irreführend. Die Fxx Tastenbeschriftung läßt sich für ältere Semester nur mit Lupe entziffern.Im Bios läßt sich Secure Boot abschalten, sogar der Legacy Modus läßt sich auswählen. Booten von USBgeht problemlos, der Linux Installation steht nichts mehr im Wege.Allein die fehlende Ethernet Schnittstelle schmerzt ewas. Aber dafür gibt es ja für den USB-C Anschluß passende Adapter. Insgesamt hardwaremäßig ein sehr empfehlenswertes kleines Notebook.

Dafür macht er seine Sache wirklich gut. Mir persönlich macht es auch nichts aus, dass beispielsweise das Konfigurationsmenü zwei Sekunden lädt, von regelrechten ""Hängern"" kann man hier nicht sprechen. Weiterhin ist für mich der Windows 11-S-Modus ausreichend, da sämtliche Googleservices, wie Mail oder Drive sowieso über den Browser erreichbar sind, da benötigt man keine entsprechende App aus dem Microsoftstore. Alles in allem bekommt man für 199 Euro ein ordentliches Notebook, wenn man seine Ansprüche anpasst.Zusatz nach ca. zwei Monaten:Nach dem Wechsel auf Linux Ubuntu wirkt der Rechner wie ausgewechselt. Jetzt merkt man erst, wie ressourcenfressend die Windowsinstallation - zumal im 11s-Modus - überhaupt ist. Er läuft viel flüssiger und kann mehrere Programme gleichzeitig stemmen.

Für komplexes Multitasking oder rechenintensive Spiele sollte man allerdings auf stärkere Hardware zurückgreifen. Der Accu machte bis jetzt einen guten Eindruck und ist für meine Bedürfnisse mehr als ausreichend. Wer sich nicht ständig über das WLAN mit dem Internet verbinden will, dem empfehle ich einen Netzwerkadapter  (USB-C auf RJ45). Damit kann man sich auch über ein LAN-Kabel mit dem Internet verbinden, wenn die Möglichkeit besteht.  Wenn man den S- Modus abschaltet kann man auch andere Software installieren (z.B.

Mails checken, an Zoom Meetings teilnehmen, mit Kommilitonen sich auszutauschen und natürlich auch zum Programmieren.Vorab, ich habe für den Laptop um die 470€ mit Versand und MwSt ~500€ ausgegeben und mit ein Paar Euro mehr hätte man einen qualitativeren Laptop kaufen können.Der Laptop (je nach Ausführung) kommt mit 8GB RAM und einem I3-1115G4. Zwar reicht der i3 völlig aus für simples Programmieren mit Python,Java, C und co. bei komplexen Simulationen würde es aber aufhören. Alleine schon beim programmieren kommt er auf seine Grenzen. Mit IntelliJ (die IDE meines Vertrauens) und den Plugins komme ich bei einer RAM Auslastung von 60-70% und erreiche Düsenjet Level an Lautstärke. Es hindert wirklich den Workflow, vor allem wenn man parallel noch was offen hat wird der Laptop super langsam. Dazu ist er auch relativ hoch und das Display ist matt. Heißt in der Sonne werdet ihr Probleme haben was zu erkennen.Der Akku ist ein anderes Thema, beim normalen Arbeiten (Programmieren + Vorlesungsfolien/PDFs offen haben) kommt er auf 2 Stunden Laufzeit und muss aufgeladen werden.

She still thinks it's the same as mine.The plastic is cheaper than the 5 pro but it's really hard to tell. You have to know.The prize is really really good. I would only wish it had a usb-c charging port but you can't have everything I guess. Value for money should be the name of the model. Also Wide View displays are now the best you can get. Much more confort, especially if running windows 11.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Germany on 10 March 2022","5.0 out of 5 stars"

Für den Preis gibt's nichts zu mäkeln, schöne, schlichte und schnelle Rechner. Das ideaPad i3 für Office und Programmierarbeiten, das ThinkPad i7 für Media Anwendungen und Bildbearbeitung.

Lenovo gibt mir keine Möglichkeit es noch umzutauschen oder mein Geld zurück zu bekommen. Wenn ich gewusst hätte, dass es so läuft, hätte ich es nie gekauft. Nie wieder von Lenovo!UPDATE: Ich hasse dieses Laptop und auch Lenovo Support!! Der Laptop lässt es seit Anfang an nicht zu, einige Websites zu besuchen. Einfach nur so, normale Webseits kann man nicht öffnen, weil man dann plötzlich auf der Google Homepage ist. Jetzt geht der Spaß aber wirklich los, auch werden Websites auf deren man zugreifen kann nicht korrekt angezeigt, man kann die Sites gar nicht benutzen, alles ist ein Chaos. Ab und zu ist man an WLAN verbunden, WLAN funktioniert auf alle andere Geräte, aber auf dem Laptop geht es einfach nicht, bis man ein restart macht. Er funktioniert sehr langsam.Lenovo support: Wegen schlechte Akku und sehr sehr sehr heißer Laptop angerufen, nach 3h am Telefon-> ok für 3 Tage und dann wieder schlechtAm Anfang war der Laptop sehr gut, schnell, alles ok. ( akku war nur 4h aber egal). Nach einige Monate wird es jetzt so heiß dass, meine Finger bei Tippen verbrennen. 10 % akku verliert man in 5 minute. Muss ständing eingesteckt sein und brennt deshalb. Cursor blockiert sich usw.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Germany on 5 June 2022","5.0 out of 5 stars"
