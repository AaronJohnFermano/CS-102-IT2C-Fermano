These are roomy in all the right places and don't make you look like a complete slob.  Really solid material and comfortable for work and just running around. They have a perfect length too so you don't walk the line of looking like you're wearing a shirt dress, or so short your gut hangs out every time you reach up.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Canada on 19 August 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars"

"47","String","D'Addario EJ16 Phosphor Bronze Acoustic Guitar Strings, Light, 12-53","Tribina Marak","I have been using Daddario phosphor bronze for last 3 years. Excellent sound quality in budget range.. If you play regularly, they will easily last upto 5 months, until they get rusted. Tuning stability is good, but initially they might get detuned due to phosphor coating slippage.To check for ordinal daddario, always remember that there will a matt rubber type coating on the packet surface and inside packet, there will be a unique code which you can verify on official daddario site","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in India on 25 March 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars"
