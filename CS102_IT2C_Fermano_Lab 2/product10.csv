"1","Electronics","CORSAIR iCUE 4000X RGB Tempered Glass Mid-Tower ATX PC Case - 3x SP120 RGB ELITE Fans - iCUE Lighting Node CORE Controller - High Airflow - Black","ALI MAHJOUB","This is hands down the best PC case you can find for a very fair price. If it's your first time building a PC, then I definitely recommend you this case as it's sooooo easy to install everything in it and it will take around 2 hours to install everything inside it meanwhile normally with other cases... it could take up to 5 hours. It also comes with 3 RGB fans which cost 30$ each separately. The material and quality on this case is the best you can fund out there. And after all... it's CORSAIR.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Australia on 30 November 2023","4.7 out of 5 stars"
"2","Electronics","CORSAIR iCUE 4000X RGB Tempered Glass Mid-Tower ATX PC Case - 3x SP120 RGB ELITE Fans - iCUE Lighting Node CORE Controller - High Airflow - Black","Kenny","Thats the best case I had ever.I am not sure If all cases are that good in the recent days but that made my life much more enjoyable while installing my PC.The best part of this case is that the cables are pre-alligned. You only need to route your PSU cables which is very simple as the bad boy comes with cable wrappers.It comes with anti-dust mat which can hopefully prevent dust getting in, I dont know how it affects the airflow but it works well for my mid-high end pc with decent cpu/gpu temp.The rubbered legs are with good quality. Fans are not noisy as well. Only thing is the side panels are only attached via a hook, It can drop the panel if you open the side panels quickly.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Australia on 27 October 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars"

Two flaws, the built in RGB hub is missing its plastic housing, and one of the front fans has lost all LED functionality, which is a poor performance for a ""RGB"" case.

"5","Electronics","CORSAIR iCUE 4000X RGB Tempered Glass Mid-Tower ATX PC Case - 3x SP120 RGB ELITE Fans - iCUE Lighting Node CORE Controller - High Airflow - Black","Pompomlam","Too expensive, $250 is not cheap but it can fit 10 120mm fan inside and keep temps at 55 on a 35C+ hot day while working on it.Has plenty of room and was designed with water cooling in mind, very large case however, weighs 14kgs on its own.The HDD bay hasn't got enough clearance to fit with an average sized PSU, Corsair sell a PSU that fits comfortably but is also expensive, be sure to invest in SSDs instead and remove the HDD bay alltogether","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Australia on 12 January 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars"
"6","Electronics","CORSAIR iCUE 4000X RGB Tempered Glass Mid-Tower ATX PC Case - 3x SP120 RGB ELITE Fans - iCUE Lighting Node CORE Controller - High Airflow - Black","Nirav Sharma","First case I've bought in over 5 years, replacing my trusty Fractal Define R4, which was a very well insulated and quiet case.Building was very easy, and had proper cable management routing. The white lacquer paint where the motherboard sits on gets scratched easily, so be careful.Initial impressions was that it was noisy, but some fan tuning fixed that. As it is more airy, there will be more dust and that's where I'm hoping the dust filters do their job. Time will tell.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Australia on 25 January 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars"

"8","Electronics","CORSAIR iCUE 4000X RGB Tempered Glass Mid-Tower ATX PC Case - 3x SP120 RGB ELITE Fans - iCUE Lighting Node CORE Controller - High Airflow - Black","Jack O'Rielly","So this is a nice minimalist case overall, but my previous case that I had was much better in terms of filtering dust. This case doesn't have a proper dust filter. Just a mesh and it gets dusty real fast. With this case I would need to dust out my pc every 6 months or less because it does start to pile up slowly whereas my other case I could leave it for 2 years or so because it had foam infront of the fan to filter that dust. Only complaint about it.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Australia on 15 May 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars"

I decided to vertically mount my graphics card, the only problem is that you cannot see anything inside unless you have a ton of RGB. Apart from that Awesome temps and plenty of room for cable management","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Australia on 15 February 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars"
"10","Electronics","CORSAIR iCUE 4000X RGB Tempered Glass Mid-Tower ATX PC Case - 3x SP120 RGB ELITE Fans - iCUE Lighting Node CORE Controller - High Airflow - Black","Marie-anne Walkington","An excellent mid sized case with a glass side panel - be aware it is quite dark! I also heard that the glass panels are difficult to obtain in Australia. Other than that this is a well designed case. I removed the 3.5in HDD bay at the bottom and this gave me heaps more space behind the PSU. The bay also moves a bit forward if do you have 3.5in drives to give a bit more space for cables at the back of the PSU. There are heaps of options for different sized fans and rads. The back side has a channel for cables and it comes with screws and velco fasteners. Would recommend this product","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Australia on 4 November 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars"

Comes at the back wire lanes with Corsair velcro straps for easier cable management. Overall a very nice case.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Australia on 30 November 2023","4.7 out of 5 stars"
"12","Electronics","CORSAIR iCUE 4000X RGB Tempered Glass Mid-Tower ATX PC Case - 3x SP120 RGB ELITE Fans - iCUE Lighting Node CORE Controller - High Airflow - Black","Kenny","Great case for the price.I really like the look of the front with the tessellated triangles, and even better that the tempered glass side panel is offset by the open front with easily removable dust filter. The case overall is nice and open, which means that you don't have to worry about populating the case with fans and optimising the fan pressure to get air through.The back of the case is spacious enough to accommodate bulky cables, and the removable cable guide is a great touch to help route and tie cables together.The downsides are that the grey feet and the front parts are plastic which feels a bit cheap, and that there's fairly limited I/O, e.g. ONLY ONE USB-A port in the front which takes up an entire USB3.0 header on the motherboard. It would have made more sense having 2 USB-A ports and a USB-C port instead of one of each.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Australia on 27 October 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars"

"16","Electronics","CORSAIR iCUE 4000X RGB Tempered Glass Mid-Tower ATX PC Case - 3x SP120 RGB ELITE Fans - iCUE Lighting Node CORE Controller - High Airflow - Black","Anthony Bate","Im very happy with the case! to be honest I was actually a little shocked when it came SO early, it was said to arrive on the 30th of December but came today the 21st of December. I do wish it came with more protection for the glass panel, but otherwise is a very nice and good looking case. As you can see in one of the pictures there is masking tape holding down the meshing on the top of the case - which I was very happy about because that reassured me that the meshing wouldn't be crinkled or something lol.Would definitely recommend this to my friends (especially since their cases are close to needing a new upgrade lol)can't wait to build my pc, loving the case - I hope putting my parts into the case won't be too much of a hassle.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Australia on 6 September 2023","3.0 out of 5 stars"
