"3","Gardening","[Upgraded] Soil Moisture Meter, 4-in-1 Soil pH Tester, Soil Moisture/Light/Nutrients/pH Meter for Gardening, Lawn, Farming, Indoor & Outdoor Plants Use, No Batteries Required","W. Turner","I love This little garden tool!  I keep composting worms to break down our table scraps and create worm castings for my houseplants and vegetable garden. Worms need a high moisture environment and a relatively neutral pH to thrive and produce a lot of castings so I this meter dozens of times each week.Over the years, I’ve purchased more expensive devices for pH monitoring as well as the cheap moisture meters that are all over Amazon. None of them has worked well. Either they have given bad readings or they're too cumbersome to use easily.When I saw this soil meter, with its unique design, and multi-functionality, I decided to give it a try. i had very low expectations because of my other experiences.I'm so glad I did. this meter is easy to use and highly responsive to different soil conditions. When I move from each worm bin, the moisture readings change, as you would expect. Sometimes a little and sometimes a lot. And I believe the accuracy is good too. Soil that seems dry gives a lower reading than soil that I know is more wet.I don't have as much to say about the pH meter. All my readings are between 6.5 and just over 7, as I would expect.  But the readings do change from sample to sample so I'm confident it's working.I don't use the light meter regularly but when I check my houseplants, I get readings that seem about right.  Same with the nutrients setting.If I had one critique, I'd say that the scale on the pH meter could be more centered around 7. It ranges from 1 to 8. Any readings below 5 or above 9 aren't too useful for gardening, but easily being able to see if the pH is 6.75 or 7.25 would be.Other than that I'm thrilled with this device, especially for the price. If I broke it tomorrow, I wouldn't hesitate to buy another.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 1 March 2023","4.0 out of 5 stars"

The pH scale goes from 1 to 7, so if your try to see if you pH is anywhere  between 5 and 7, good luck getting any accuracy. We were only worried between 6 and 7, and you can't tell if it's 6.5 or 7. So we returned it for a meter with a digital pH meter so we can have some resemblance of accuracy, so we can control the pH of out gardens so we can get more vegetables out of out garden for winter storage and canning.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Canada on 28 June 2023","3.0 out of 5 stars"

The others have 2 prongs and this one has one large prong. The ones with the 2 prongs are very flimsy and break after about 2 months. This one has one large sturdy prong that you insert into soil. The other thing is it’s much easier to read because the head tilts so you don’t have to get down on the ground to see it.

I bought this with my own money to try and give my own opinion.I bought this not expecting much, but I figured why not give it a try and see how it performs. Right out of the box it is surprisingly built well enough that I don’t feel like it’s going to break anytime soon although time will tell. It comes in a cheap box from China but it is packaged well to where it will not get banged around in shipping. When I first put this meter to the test I was surprised that the readings are pretty close to what the actual condition of the soil is. The light meter function works well in the sun. I was kind of bummed to see it will not work with my grow lights (it states this in the instructions but I tested anyway). The moisture feature is pretty accurate I first measured bone dry soil and it was accurate so I gradually added water and kept checking and the meter registered exactly what I was seeing. The nutrient function seems to be reading pretty accurate for what I believe to be in the soil but I’m skeptical of this I will have to do further testing on this function and compare with other meters and report back on this one. The PH function works as accurate as the other functions. I started with alkaline soil PH 7 and stuck the probe in and it registered it with no problem. I then started adding PH down (hydroponic ACID) to the water and added it to the soil. The meter registered the PH as acidic PH 3 which is accurate compared to digital PH meter and PH solution. Overall I’m impressed. This is a nice little meter for everyday gardening and to get an idea of how your soil and plants are doing. I wouldn’t use just this meter on prized plants and rely only on this meter but it is definitely worth having on hand.If this company has other products I would be willing to try the other products as well to see how they perform as well as recommend this product to friends.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 12 September 2022","4.0 out of 5 stars"

Some of my lawn is doing great, other areas not thriving. The measurements taken using this seems to match up to what I am seeing.Areas not thriving, ph is high and nutrient level low. Areas doing well have correct ph and decent nutrient reading.Helped me treat lawn as zones and hit with fertilizer a little heavier in some areas with lower nutrient levelYou will want to ensure that soil has some moisture to get accurate readings as it needs moisture to conduct signalI suspect this will save me money on lawn fertilizer over time. Once I get a baseline, I will know it's time to fertilize when I see reading dropThe ph reading seems fairly sensitive and although I don't have a control to compare it to. It seems to match up to what I am seeing in how well the grass is growing.From the directions, you should not pour or rinse with water. Wipe it with a towel and don't rinse it. I think if you leave in a pot, sensors will corrode and I will loose accuracy. Definitely don't want to water your plant while sensor is in pot.I was trying to figure out if it has battery or is solar powered or maybe powered by sensor electrodes. From what I can tell, there is no battery unless it is sealed inside with no cover.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 29 August 2023","4.0 out of 5 stars"

Later I realized that the packaging included a small piece of sandpaper and instructions to lightly sand the sensor if it stopped working. I'm not sure now where I put the sensory, so I don't know for sure that it would have helped, but I'm adding 2 stars based on the assumption that it would have.Original review:I bought this mainly for the moisture reader, since other reviews indicated that the other functions may not work well. The moisture reader was great at first and helped me stop over watering my majesty, but stopped working after 2 months.

For instance, on the cheap green ones you find at your local hardware store would barely move the needle in my blueberry patch.  I had done everything I could think of to get the PH down but the meter wouldn't move.  I got one of these and made the same tests and discovered PH of between 4.0 and 5.5.  Holy Cow!  I was validated!  Yeah, I like this thing.  However, don't leave it outside to get rained on.  It's not water proof.  I had to take mine apart to clear out the moisture.

Smith","Its fine, as described. Cons: probe is huge leaves a big hole in the soil. It takes a couple minutes to get a moisture reading. Not good for small pots unless you stand there and hold it. Otherwise, the top-heavy meter will tip the pot.  It doesn't appear to measure any amount of indirect/ambient sunlight. I've tried to measure the degree of indirect light in areas of a sunny room, trying to keep low light plants from burning. However, it only reacts to full sun near the window or in a beam of light, in which case it springs to the highest number. I found no way to measure degrees of light between full sun and darkness. Maybe its scientifically impossible with such a simple meter, but if thats the case, then its useless and they just shouldn't include it..

In other words, if you expose the sensor to sunlight the needle goes up, and if you cover the sensor with your thumb the needle goes down. Not sure who this is useful for. Is there a population of people who cannot identify sunlit areas with their eyes, but who can read the meter with their eyes?* Real electronic pH meters need frequent calibration, so I have zero hope for the pH function.* The soil moisture sensing seems to work the same as any probe.

The moisture and fertility gauges are easy to view. The light sensor works just fine as well, but it's not really needed unless possibly for inside or under artificial light. It is pretty easy to see if the sun is shining on your plants. The instructions are ok but the print is pretty small.

But the other features work really well and my suspicions about my soil's PH and nutrient richness in different vessels were confirmed. I also watered a pot with new soil (which was a bit more alkaline that I'd like) with water containing a bit of vinegar and it sure showed the lower PH than the original. We have very hard water here so acidifying my soil is necessary for some plants.I finger-tested the moisture in the soil in different pots and then used the tester and all went well too, which is great. I also tried the tester in different pots that were fertilized on different occasions and the nutrient levels were as expect, especially the explosion of the dial when measuring nutrients in a bucket with soil and kitchen scraps :).So for now I'm very happy with my new tool. Thanks!","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 9 December 2022","5.0 out of 5 stars"
