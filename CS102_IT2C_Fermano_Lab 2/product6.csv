"3","Shorts","Hanes Men's Short Sleeve Beefy T (Pack of 2)","Mrs susan","Even unwrapping these t-shirts I knew they were going to be big. Upon donning them I was right, they are huge. In fact I bought another brand at the same time also in XXL and laying one on top of the other showed a significant difference in size. The Hanes Beefy shirts are at least 3XL using other makes as a guide. It's not a huge issue, I wear tees in winter for layering, but they're so big they look daggy at the neck, the only part that shows. Made in Haiti so it's gratifying to see manufacturing in poor countries adjacent to the US. They are thick as advertised, but in the absence of significant shrinkage I'd go a size down, hoping of course that the size difference is consistent across the Hanes Beefy range (i.e. one size too big). The image shown has Aquagard T-shirts in XXL on top of the Hanes in XXL and the difference is significant- and the yellow shirts were larger than other XXL tees I've purchased recently.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Australia on 11 January 2024","3.0 out of 5 stars"

"12","Shorts","Hanes Men's Short Sleeve Beefy T (Pack of 2)","Allan R Ricci","I ordered  2 different colours in XL - red and blue.  They arrived seperately and the red was manufactured in Ethiopia while the blue was manufactured in Haiti. I have been wearing and washing both colours for a few months and find that the red has way too big a neck opening  compared to the blue and hence does not feel as good a fit around the neck and shoulder area making me not want to wear the red at all.I am very happy with the quality of the fabric and really like the Haynes beefy T's , but I am now wary of ordering some more as I dont know which colour/manufacturer combinations are which.You should expect consistent quality between the manufacturing locations.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Australia on 12 December 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars"

"29","Shorts","Hanes Men's Short Sleeve Beefy T (Pack of 2)","Lori W","My husband was frustrated with other brands of T-Shirts being too thin and thus, not very attractive to wear out and about.  I suggested he try a Hanes Beefy-T, so he got a white one and loves it so much, I've purchased several in different colors for his Christmas gift.  As well made and long-wearing as these are, he should be set for quite some time.  Beefy-Ts are, without a doubt, the absolute best T-Shirts you can buy, and you definitely won't regret the purchase.  These are all cotton, so if you're vacillating about which size to buy, go with the larger one just to be sure it'll stiff fit beautifully after going through the washer and dryer.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Australia on 19 January 2021","5.0 out of 5 stars"
"30","Shorts","Hanes Men's Short Sleeve Beefy T (Pack of 2)","Tgm","I seldom wear t-shirts for anything other than walking the dog and sleeping in.  I dislike the seams, tags and stretching that after a short while distorts the fit and thus the look of the shirt.  The heavy Beefy-T has none of the aforementioned issues.  It's extremely well made with just the right weight fabric to resist stretching AND tagless.  The fabric wears like iron to the point where the neckline of my favorite Beffy-T sleep shirt wore through after 8 years use before requiring replacement.  If you're buying expensive T-shirts from American  Apparel of the like you are wasting large sums of money.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Australia on 9 December 2020","5.0 out of 5 stars"

"33","Shorts","Hanes Men's Short Sleeve Beefy T (Pack of 2)","NC","Wanted a good quality t-shirt that actually fitted me, and that is what I recieved. I am about 5'9 and ordered a medium. The t-shirts themselves are not exactly a thick material, but they're not thin, they feel smooth. If there was one thing I would say, it's that they are a tiny bit too long on the torso, not as bad as some t-shirts that claim to be a medium, but it would be the perfect t-shirt, if it wasn't just that inch too long on the torso (but this is just my preference, I prefer a shorter torso length on a t-shirt).","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 14 October 2023","3.0 out of 5 stars"

"41","Shorts","Hanes Men's Short Sleeve Beefy T (Pack of 2)","Mrs susan","I bought these for my husband months ago and they are still in great shape. He works for a tree company and his clothes generally get ripped, stained, and ruined after just a few weeks (and many times, days!)These two shirts are worn at least once or twice per week, while working, and are in the same shape as when I bought them. There are no holes or rips anywhere on the shirts and they are just as strong as when I received them. Stains are impossible to avoid, but the shirt couldn't be of better quality and durability even months after purchasing them.The color and description are the same as pictured and described by the seller.This is a great deal on two high quality Men's short sleeved t-shirts, and I would definitively recommend them!I bought these shirts at full price. When I'm very satisfied with a purchase, I like to give a review and hopefully help or answer some questions potential buyers may have.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Australia on 11 January 2024","4.4 out of 5 stars"

"46","Shorts","Hanes Men's Short Sleeve Beefy T (Pack of 2)","Dwayne Walker","This is a great t-shirt if you get the right size. I had to try three different sizes! If you normally buy tall sizes, don't get these in a tall size unless you're really tall, like at least 6'8"" or taller. Regardless of your size, buy one size larger unless you prefer a snug to tight fit. They are made from ""100% preshrunk cotton,"" but believe me, they do shrink a size after a normal washing and drying. I appreciate that they are 100% cotton, nothing with polyester ever feels as good, and the material is indeed ""Beefy."" I will probably buy more now that I know what size I need.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 22 January 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars"
