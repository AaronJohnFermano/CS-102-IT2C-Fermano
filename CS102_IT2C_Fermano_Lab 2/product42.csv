"9","Shorts","Russell Athletic Men's Mesh Short with Pockets","Clark Lohr","Russell Athletics makes great basketball shorts, great t-shirts, good hoodies. I'm sure there's tons of competition from other brands that are pricier and appear to be more exotic and somehow better but it's not true. Russell Athletics is good clothing--and you can get it at general merchandise stores.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 21 July 2022","5.0 out of 5 stars"
"10","Shorts","Russell Athletic Men's Mesh Short with Pockets","Zenguy","I prefer a basic, no-frills, inexpensive workout short for my exercise activities (about 1-1.5 hours per day, 3-4 times per week). After years of buying Champion brand, I decided to give the Russell product a try based on positive reviews. I found these to be a good value. What I like most about them is the fit, which is a bit looser and longer than the Champion model.  At 5'8"", 165 lbs with a 33 waist, medium is just perfect for me. The material is smooth and breathes well. The waist is snug enough for the shorts to stay put, but not too tight to be comfortable. I like the pockets, which I use to hold my little iPod shuffle during my workouts. Overall a solid product and sufficient for my purposes.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 2 March 2017","5.0 out of 5 stars"

They look good, and they feel good.One thing is that the white ones are pretty see-through, so your underwear color will show a little bit if they are dark or flashy.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Canada on 17 March 2019","4.5 out of 5 stars"

"29","Shorts","Russell Athletic Men's Mesh Short with Pockets","sallyftw","I don't usually review items promptly but the customer service is something to talk about.  I ordered a size L and they sent me an M.  The paper tag said L but the actual tag on the shorts said M so the mix-up was understandable.  I ordered a size L a second time so they would arrive on time for my boyfriend's birthday and emailed amazon about returning the size M.  I heard back right away from the seller and was told that my money will be refunded and that I do not have to go through the hassle of returning the shorts.The new shorts that were correctly labeled size L on both tags came in today and they are great.  The Texas Orange is a beautiful burnt copper color and I couldn't be happier about it.  The shorts themselves are long which is great because my boyfriend is 6ft 4 and has trouble with basketball shorts being too short sometimes, but these will look great on him.  The pockets are a big plus because he likes to have a place to put his keys and phone when he goes out.  The elastic on the shorts is really strong but very stretchy meaning that they will be comfortable but won't fall down.  What I loved the most about the shorts is how thin the material is.  My boyfriend gets very sweaty and always complains about shorts being 'too hot' but these are so airy and light that I think he will love them.  I will be ordering in more colors after I get his take on these shorts.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 27 September 2014","5.0 out of 5 stars"

"32","Shorts","Russell Athletic Men's Mesh Short with Pockets","Haron Deinla","These shorts were definitely worth the buy. A lot better than I had expected, and here's why:-the shorts a very comfy. That may be due to the mesh being a little bit bigger in perforations as compared to other mesh shorts. The perforations are big enough to provide more than enough breathing room and ventilation, but not so big that the shorts are super-see through.-the material not only feels good but looks good. I ordered the green colorway and it looks really nice. I'm even planning on making another order, that is if I decide whether or not these are better quality than Champion branded shorts.-it has pockets which is a must for me when it comes to shorts I plan to use on a consistent basis to be able to hold my keys and wallet.-the drawstring is also strong enough so that if I were to have my phone, keys and wallet in my pockets, the shorts won't drop.All in all, these shorts are really nice, both for home use and outdoor use for walking and sports alike.If I were able to help you make a purchase, or help you prevent from making one you'd regret. Then all I ask is you thumbs up my review saying it was helpful, because knowing I helped someone out means a lot.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Canada on 10 August 2016","5.0 out of 5 stars"

"42","Shorts","Russell Athletic Men's Mesh Short with Pockets","Scott Ivlow","I like Russel Athletic shorts for the brand it well worth the price. Rice hole mesh with pockets can be a hard find. Walmart's private label Athletic Works brand is so is Champion. However Russel Athletic is my second primary Sports Apperal Brand. Like having R. However they put it on everything they make. On this Black Mesh short you should get the Color R logo and not a White R. Dri Power isn't marked but it's a polyester material which makes it water resistant. I wear medium size shorts but with Russsel Athletics the waistbands have so much stretch and I don't need exessive baggy leg holes I always buy a size small and still get the same perfect fit as a medium and a 7"" inseam which is still perfect with my 6'2"" height. I hate long baggy basketball shorts. With Russel Athleticsit's baggy but not overly baggy in a small. I have multiple colors on these mesh shorts and continue to add more. Mesh material is so smooth and comfortable.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 3 December 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars"
