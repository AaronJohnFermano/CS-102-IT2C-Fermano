"4","Shorts","Wrangler Mens Performance Comfort Flex Waist Cargo Short Cargo Shorts","usernotaloser","I bought a very similar pair of Wrangler shorts at Wal-Mart and the fabric was much thicker and better quality than this pair.  These feel kinda cheap; the fabric feels like it could tear fairly easily while the store bought pair, despite being used heavily for cycling for months and washed many times are now faded but the fabric and stitching are fine.Edit to my previous post ...My previous opinion was that I wouldn't buy these again but now after using them for some time, the fabric is holding out very well .... still feel very light and the mesh pockets are a little shallow.  Still a decent short.  I do hope they come out with the original pair of Wrangler shorts I bought almost two years ago.  They have a much sturdier fabric though a little heavy in really hot summer days.  Sturdiness and good pockets mean more than style etc. to me.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Canada on 29 April 2020","5.0 out of 5 stars"

"8","Shorts","Wrangler Mens Performance Comfort Flex Waist Cargo Short Cargo Shorts","Darlut & MyCorn","Size: I'm legit 38"" if not a little more. A lot of the reviews say true to size so I ordered the 38"".  If I lost a pound and jumped up and down they would have fallen to my ankles.  I guess if you like wearing a belt and like that really loose feel then stick to the 38"".  I'm big shoulders no butt so I need that little bit of extra tension to keep my drawers up. I reordered the 36"" and they fit great. Puts the ""Flex"" to a little but of test but that's what it's there for and it's comfortable. Also the smaller size looks better because the legs aren't so large. There was a huger difference between the 38"" and 36"".Performance: I usually graduate my clothes to ""yard gear"" after they have had a year or so of normal wear. I immediately put these to the test doing yard work and I will wear these from now on.  They were light which kept me cool, the waist was flexible but comfortably snug and the front pockets were deep enough to hold my phone with no issues. I push-mow a large yard and bag the clippings. My neighbors will appreciate that now when I bend over to remove the bagger they won't be confused that a plumber is doing my yardwork. Highly recommend these and also recommend the Flex version of the Wrangler jeans that are sized in a similar fashion.  I have bought another pair and will likely buy a few more. I would even work out at the gym in these when that time comes... maybe having these will motivate me to get there.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 7 April 2021","5.0 out of 5 stars"

"15","Shorts","Wrangler Mens Performance Comfort Flex Waist Cargo Short Cargo Shorts","BryWill32606","I am able to wear shorts to work and I saw these and figured to give them a try.  First I must say, as a guy I am used to the demin or thick cotton feel for pants/shorts, these are not that feel. These are a stretchy material. When wearing them they are very comfortable and when you sit, as a guy the material is stretchy so you can sit down comfortably without issues. They look like regular shorts, I feel the waistband is a little wider but not in a bad way. I have washed this pair 3x now, they wash well, no fading or coming apart as I read in one review but they do look wrinkly, not bad enough to have to iron them, besides when you put them on the wrinkles seem to go away, I think its the stretchy material that makes them look that way. I paid $27 for this paid off shorts and it's about as hight as I would want to pay. I do need to mention that I did order a second pair, black as these are more of an olive color.  I hope this review helps.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 10 September 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars"

"21","Shorts","Wrangler Mens Performance Comfort Flex Waist Cargo Short Cargo Shorts","David Zacchei","I was looking for shorts that were lightweight, wrinkle resistant, and flexible for a trip to Europe. I was also looking for extra pockets, but I don't like cargo pants with flaps or buttons. Wrangler had the perfect answer. These shorts fit great, and the material (mostly nylon) is lightweight and flexible. They come with two zipper pockets that are perfect for traveling or day-to-day. They are cut a bit narrow in the leg, which is fine for me (5'10"", 170lb.) I bought granite (dark gray) and sagebrush (grayish green). I tried the bronze but didn't like the color. I wish they came in a lighter shade, like khaki or beige.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 9 August 2023","4.6 out of 5 stars"

"31","Shorts","Wrangler Mens Performance Comfort Flex Waist Cargo Short Cargo Shorts","PM Advocate","First, the description of these cargo shorts on Amazon is totally inadequate. The absolutely most important feature of these shorts that is not evident on the Amazon web site is that they truly have STRETCH. I an a waist 33 and I ordered a 32. They fit perfectly since the waist and the pants have great stretch. They would also fit perfectly for someone with a 32 inch waist. Too many pants on the internet are described as having a stretch feature, but in fact do not. Secondly, there is not description of the pockets. These shorts have 7 pockets, but you would not know it from the website. Zippers are on the two side cargo pockets so you can secure your phone and wallet in these pockets if you will be exercising. The other pockets are deep, as is the ""watch"" pocket. Great fabric. I reordered another pair after wearing the first pair. Can't address durability, but they are made much better than my other cargo shorts. Great buy!!","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 18 June 2022","4.6 out of 5 stars"

"41","Shorts","Wrangler Mens Performance Comfort Flex Waist Cargo Short Cargo Shorts","jwl80303","I really like these shorts. They are comfortable and the material lightweight and breathable. I'd give this product 5 stars except for the defective waistband snap. It just won't stay snapped and will un-snap at the slightest pressure, like me bending over to pick something up off the floor. It's not just a 'one-off' bad pair of shorts - I ordered two pairs and both have this same problem. If I wear a belt then the belt takes the tension and the pants stay snapped, but the snap should be better designed and not require 'help' to stay closed.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 26 July 2023","4.6 out of 5 stars"

"43","Shorts","Wrangler Mens Performance Comfort Flex Waist Cargo Short Cargo Shorts","JC","I recently bought a pair of Wrangler ""Outdoor Series"" cargo shorts on clearance at a local Target store, model NT980GT. I really like the fit and the fabric and the zipper side pockets. Come to find out they were discontinued, but my searches kept bringing me back to these Wrangler ""Authentics"" cargo shorts, model ZM980GT. After carefully looking at the pictures and comparing them to my Outdoor Series pair, the pockets, the stitching, etc, appeared to be exactly the same. So I bought a pair in the hopes they were.While almost identical, this newer Authentics version is a little different than those discontinued Outdoor Series pair. First, they're about an inch longer. Not a huge difference, but I'm 6'2"" and I prefer where the Outdoor Series shorts sit above my knee. The second thing I noticed is they're slightly slimmer in fit, just a little less room around. And the waistband seems less stretchy. They clearly went cheap on the new zippers. Most people won't notice or care, but after having the better, lock-down zipper heads on the Outdoor Series, these cheap floppy zipper heads are just annoying to me. And while both shorts are listed as Granite (GT), these are lighter in color.Honestly though, for all my moaning about these slight differences, if I didn't already have the older version I wouldn't know and would be perfectly happy with these shorts. They are still just as comfortable, made with the same nylon/spandex mix, and seem just as well stitched together. Knowing the differences, my only real gripe is the zippers. Still very comfortable and well fitting shorts.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 8 March 2018","5.0 out of 5 stars"

"45","Shorts","Wrangler Mens Performance Comfort Flex Waist Cargo Short Cargo Shorts","DigDugDoug","So they're the most comfortable shorts I've ever worn, But. They don't hold up all that great, Atleast not in comparison to traditional wrangler shorts. They could easily be used as swim trunks and they feel like a mixture of that and normal shorts. Pockets functioned better than expected and I'll buy another pair to see if they'll share the same weak points such as inner thighs and the taint seam. Every now and then I get a loose thread too, No big deal but something you'd notice if bought. Would recomend going a size up if you've owned a pair previously, Bought my second pair and initial fit is awful. I'm sitting with them on to write this review incase another larger gentleman is considering these shorts. GO A SIZE UP. Other than that they were good enough to want another pair, So there's that. They'll definitely appear tight in your normal size, They hug pretty good so larger size won't hurt.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 9 May 2021","5.0 out of 5 stars"
