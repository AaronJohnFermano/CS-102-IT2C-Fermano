"2","Shorts","Dickies Men's 13 Inch Loose Fit Multi-Pocket Work Short","BunningsSnag","Excellent brand and quality. I’ve purchased a pair directly from dickies previously that fit perfectly. The problem is as has been 3 times now that when I’ve purchased size 40 inch shorts from overseas they have sent me 36 inch. Sent back first pair as they paid for postage. I received a full refund. I’m left with the second pair of carpenter denim shorts as it would cost me almost the price I paid for the shorts in postage back to the USA. Also I have a month to drop off this pair at a parcel return which is hard as the closest is 4-5 hours drive away. Bit of a scam really if you’re not from a major city that has a return facility. Be warned if you’re looking for larger sizes. I won’t be buying off here .","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Australia on 25 February 2021","5.0 out of 5 stars"
"3","Shorts","Dickies Men's 13 Inch Loose Fit Multi-Pocket Work Short","TIM H","Reading the reviews, and wanting them to be baggy like my other shorts from the 90's i ordered 2 sizes up.  Im 6ft and medium build usually a 36, so i ordered a 40.I received a 36, but the fit really well, they are the exact same size/shape as an old pair of size 38 from jayjays int he 2000's. Doesnt make any sense, but i am happy with the product i received.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Australia on 7 February 2024","1.0 out of 5 stars"
"4","Shorts","Dickies Men's 13 Inch Loose Fit Multi-Pocket Work Short","scott simpson","With Dickies, you play a lottery as to whether your purchase will fit. Sure, you may be a size 36, and own other dickies pants that are a size 36 that fit well, doesn't mean that your new size 36 purchase will fit. They are way too small, would be tight on a size 34 person.As it's an Amazon US purchase, if I opted to return the item and take out the return postage cost Amazon has set, I would be refunded 51cents.  Might as well try to flog them on ebay now.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Australia on 1 January 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars"

"32","Shorts","Dickies Men's 13 Inch Loose Fit Multi-Pocket Work Short","BunningsSnag","I bought these shorts last year and they are holding up well; however they could use a couple of design improvements. I work in a maintenance facility where I have to occasionally lay on my back and when I do my cell phone falls out of the side pocket on the pant leg, I suggest adding a pocket flap. Also the belt loops are so small they barely accommodate a 1 inch belt, the belt loops should be increased in size to allow larger belts like leather.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Australia on 25 February 2021","5.0 out of 5 stars"

Sie fällt mindestens zwei Größen kleiner aus und als ich sie mir nochmals in 34 bestellt habe stand dort auf dem Etikett zwar 34, aber von der Größe das exakt selbe Ergebnis wie bei der letzten und zwar dass 3cm fehlten, um sie überhaupt zu zu bekommen...

"37","Shorts","Dickies Men's 13 Inch Loose Fit Multi-Pocket Work Short","Markus Reischmann","I’ve worn dickies my whole life and it’s getting harder and harder to find  the good thick kind in department stores. A lot of stores are selling the cheaper thinner versions with thinner material and thin little belt loops so I’m happy to see Amazon selling the good kind for a fair price. My only disappointment was the clasp above the zipper fell off sometime during the first day I wore them. I use a belt so my pants stay up  but it sucks not being able to clip/button the waist like normal","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Germany on 4 September 2018","4.0 out of 5 stars"

"40","Shorts","Dickies Men's 13 Inch Loose Fit Multi-Pocket Work Short","Gary","First off DEFINITELY order one size bigger! I read several reviews that suggested the same and some others said the size was accurate. I ordered my typical 36 and they fit like a VERY small 34. I exchanged for a 38 and that fits great and like a 36. I can wear 34 but carry concealed so I need a bit extra and there is no way I could have carried with that 36. If fit so tight I couldn’t put even a finger in the wait. Aside from that they are great. I’m 6’3 and have a hard time finding shirts that TRULY are below the knee  but these truly are. The others that claim to be “below the knee” definitely do not but these do and for an awesome price! Only $14 when we ordered them! Durable and comfortable but don’t forget to save yourself the hassle of the exchange and just order a size up from the start.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 4 December 2023","4.0 out of 5 stars"
