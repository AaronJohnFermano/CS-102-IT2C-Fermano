"1","Mouse","Razer Viper Ultimate Lightweight Wireless Gaming Mouse & RGB Charging Dock: Hyperspeed Wireless Technology - 20K DPI Optical Sensor - 78g - Optical Mouse Switch - 70 Hr Battery - Quartz Pink","gaolmao","For only around $40 AUD, this mouse is probably the best lightweight gaming mouse to ever exist.It's quite crazy how they've been able to cram so many features for such a low price point and here are some of them:- The mouse comes at 61g, making it one of the lightest mice out there for sale. If you play FPS games such as CSGO and Valorant, you'll definitely find that the tracking on this mouse is relatively easy.- The Razer Viper Mini uses PTFE skates. For people who don't know what that is, PTFE is basically the material that manufacturers use to create non-stick pans. It works great on a mouse pad too though.- For RGB lovers out there, the Razer Viper Mini, unlike its other Viper variants, has RGB underglow. It looks great when you're not using it but you probably won't be able to see it when your hand is covering it. It's funny though because the Razer Viper Mini has more RGB features while weighing less than other mice.- The actual design of the mouse itself is probably why it's so popular. The Viper Mini is definitely one of the most comfortable mice I've used. It fits great on your hand and the mouse buttons are positioned well to reduce thumb movement. The speed flex cable that Razer uses is also great as the mouse essentially feels wireless and weighs next to nothing.The only thing about the Razer Viper Mini that could potentially sway consumers away from it is its form factor. The only reason it's able to reach such a low weight is due to how small it is. People with large hands will find this mouse hard to use. The Viper Mini also doesn't come with grip tape like the Viper Ultimate or the Basilisk Ultimate, but its low cost of $40 AUD makes up for that.Overall I definitely recommend this product if you're in the need of a great budget mouse.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Australia on 25 May 2022","4.5 out of 5 stars"
"2","Mouse","Razer Viper Ultimate Lightweight Wireless Gaming Mouse & RGB Charging Dock: Hyperspeed Wireless Technology - 20K DPI Optical Sensor - 78g - Optical Mouse Switch - 70 Hr Battery - Quartz Pink","PepsiMaxDrinker","It’s so good, mainly for its light weight and good clicks, would recommend. I bought this wanting a better gaming mouse from a name brand, and found this. A week after I got it I started butterfly clicking and even though this is a jitter clicking mouse, it is an amazing all-around gaming mouse and would buy again. EDIT: After a good 6 months or so later I still love this mouse and frequently use it but there are a few problems, Sometimes the click creaks and squeaks but it isn’t enough to bug me enough to buy another mouse. The other problem is the software. The software is pretty average. All it does is rob but there is some weird other software which tells me that I can’t change my RGB to what I personally want it to change to. But other than those little problems it is a flawless mouse and would buy it again. 🖱","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Australia on 16 September 2022","5.0 out of 5 stars"
"3","Mouse","Razer Viper Ultimate Lightweight Wireless Gaming Mouse & RGB Charging Dock: Hyperspeed Wireless Technology - 20K DPI Optical Sensor - 78g - Optical Mouse Switch - 70 Hr Battery - Quartz Pink","gaolmao","Great value mice, bought as something to quickly replace a favourite g502 (a substantially larger and heavier mouse esp. with all weights in). Buttons are industry standard. Cable is light, even with 80% hanging off the table. Razer Synapse is tolerable.The default lift off height felt noticeably high with a soft cloth mousepad (DM PAD L), so much that I've had to calibrate using the software to the Razer Vespula V2 Cloth and reduce 'Lift-Off Range' to 1.Now my main gripe with the mouse and what prompted me to write this review is the scroll wheel. Other reviewers mention issues with the scroll wheel click or a lack of free scroll, but worse yet I often find myself fiddling with a scroll wheel that triggers a stutter scroll in the opposite direction each swipe of the wheel either due to a lack of tactility or resistance or design of the scroll wheel... or a firmware(?) issue. This could be manufacturing deviance.This frustration builds up if you scroll a lot, and if you've found this review, I can imagine you might have scrolled quite a bit.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Australia on 25 May 2022","3.0 out of 5 stars"

Really disappointing. It was covered under warranty but it seemed like too much issue to chase up. Hopefully if you buy this mouse you get a unit with a better scroll wheel.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Australia on 27 May 2022","5.0 out of 5 stars"

"11","Mouse","Razer Viper Ultimate Lightweight Wireless Gaming Mouse & RGB Charging Dock: Hyperspeed Wireless Technology - 20K DPI Optical Sensor - 78g - Optical Mouse Switch - 70 Hr Battery - Quartz Pink","gaolmao","I like the mouse overall, it feels comfortable to use, and the adjustability of the Razer software is also a bonus. However, there's an annoying scroll wheel issue, where dust constantly finds its way into the scroll wheel, leading to it scrolling upwards when I'm going downwards and vice-versa. It seems built into the design, as others complain about the same problem. The only way to fix it temporarily is to blow air into it. It gets clogged up quite often and needs to have the dust removed every 2-3 days on average.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Australia on 25 May 2022","4.5 out of 5 stars"

It’s a small mouse with 2 side buttons it’s got RGB on the Razer logo and a under glow on the bottom of the mouse to display more RGB definitely get the Razer synapse to customise the look of the mouse. Also it has really nice clicking sounds but can be a little loud still a good pickup to anyone looking for a budget Razer mouse But if you have large hands and like to palm your mouse then you should pick up a normal sized viper.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Australia on 16 September 2022","5.0 out of 5 stars"
"13","Mouse","Razer Viper Ultimate Lightweight Wireless Gaming Mouse & RGB Charging Dock: Hyperspeed Wireless Technology - 20K DPI Optical Sensor - 78g - Optical Mouse Switch - 70 Hr Battery - Quartz Pink","D R","The comfort of this mouse was extremely suitable for me as I have small-medium hands. The weight of this mouse was just perfect!The only reason I am rating this as 3 stars is mostly because it keeps disconnecting to my PS4 slim every time I plug it in ( I think there is something wrong with my PS4 USB port that doesn’t support the razer viper mini), which is unfortunate. The thing is it’s only the razer viper mini’s USB plug that keeps disconnecting and not my keyboard plug, and my old mouse plug it’s pretty weird haha. Oh well.But it does work perfectly fine for windows since there is no issues as I tested with my Laptop.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Australia on 28 April 2023","3.0 out of 5 stars"

Only issue i have is its quite glitchy which I wouldnt have expected from a mouse made light and intended for gamers. I havent figured out whether this is the mouse itself or the connection to my computer or something but i cant say i had this issue with my previous mouse that was also wired.. a shame if its the mouse as its quite frustrating.

I have medium to small hands, so this suits me very well and the customisation options on the drivers make the device very very compatible with whatever I am doing. Changing to custom sens, lighting, refresh rate of info (the 1000hertz thingy), and changing mouse button assignments. LOVE the mouse and am thinking of getting a razor mousepad, since the mouse can be calibrated with the mouse pad which is super exciting.Great mouse for games like Valorant, since you don't have ANY spinning out.
